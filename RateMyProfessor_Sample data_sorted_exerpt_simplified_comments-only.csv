A GOOD INSTRUCTOR HIGHLY RECOMMENDABLE FOR ENG 1010 CLASS IF YOU WANT TO MAKE AN A HE ALSO DASH OUT POINTS IN ORDER TO HELP YOU HAVE GOOD GRADE HE IS GOOD;
A very good instructor he is highly recommendable for english courses.;
Excellent instructor. Is not easy, but makes class fun. Lots of writing. Did not lik group essay, but all else fairly easy. Some reading/bookwork but great class.;
Personally I think he is the best Professor in Brooklyn College. Simply not enough space to tell you all the good things about him. He really makes it easy to do well in a tough class. Show up to class and take notes, make sure you understand the material and you will do not just fine but get an A. If you want to understand Stats you must take him.;
Respected, organized and professional. He gives over hard concepts in a clear manner. It\'s a focused setting.;
I really learned American government.;
No Comments;
Have had him for several classes. Study the power point and you will get an A but know it inside and out. He is a wonderful caring professor who will go out of his way to explain things. Sometimes he seems a little annoyed if you ask too many questions but he always is willing to answer them. You get out of class early.;
Actually really good. Course policies are incredibly clear. Strict (a good thing, in my opinion) but fair. Homeworks are challenging but rewarding. There is never any ambiguity here, which is a good thing.;
Bad Explanations;
this guy is great, the lectures tend to e dry, but, hes very helpfula nd hell do anything he an to help u pass. tests are difficult, but reports are simple. worth taking, just try and stay awake;
Avdulov-Sensei will change your life. His classes are rigorous, although not necessarily difficult to do well in. Dedication and attendance are mandatory, however if you put forth the effort he will make sure you get an A in his course. He is both professional, and enthusiastic, and integrates both Japanese culture and language into his lessons.;
He is the best professor in entire UHCL .I have seen most of the professors in UHCL but none like him , character wise and as a teacher. Very soft person , dosent get angry at all. He knows the subject very well and has great knowledge in it . Most on them take advantage of his lineance and dont listen to class .Hes a great personality.;
Terrible at explaining key concepts. Makes uncomfortable and inappropriate sexual jokes, or at least did for my classes. Nice dude though.;
great teacher, he works with you and is very freindly. show up for his class and do his work, and you\'ll be fine. don\'t talk while he teaches, doesnt like it at all. i highly recommend him.;
I regret taking her class... So many better professors at York, in my opinion. I really do think there are many more qualified professors at the institution than her to be chair/dean. Also found her class really boring. She\'s a decent person over all though.;
Awesome teacher. Always comes into class fully prepared and happy to teach. She gives you weeks ahead of time so you can organize yourself early on. She has a lot of connections and experience in law so it would be wise to be friendly with her in hopes she can help you out in the future. Take this class, enjoy it, and receive an easy A.;
Literally the best professor I\'ve ever had;
One of my favorite classes at Loyola. She is the sweetest professor and she really cares about you. She is always there for you if you need help in her class. This class is not the easiest, but it is do-able and go to office hours. do all the homework and you will do good on the test. Preparing for the class is how you will get an A in this class.;
Delamater is incredibly knowledgeable and has a lot to say. This can work against him, however, because he will often go on and on about something that could have been said in 2 minutes. He is also disrespectful--making students feel embarrassed for saying the wrong thing, mocking students, rolling his eyes.;
be sure to see him in his office hours if you want to do well, fortunately he seemed to have more office hours then the rest of my professors combined, papers take about 3 hours to write and about the same amount of time to edit;
I was excited to take his Sex in the City one program, and the first term was okay, but the second he just piggy backed off of the other one program profs, and had very little to do with sexual diversity. He doesn\'t care for his students\' opinions or mental health, and though some of the readings and trips were good, an overall disappointment.;
Prof Lesk is an amazing speaker. His lectures are clear, concise, and very interesting. He grades fairly, but not too rough. I think the negative feedback for him on here must mostly be from people who didn\'t do their readings and consequently got poor marks. He doesn\'t put up with offensive opinions, but encourages discussion.;
The 199 courses are great for breath requirements, and this course was no exception. It was a very fun course. There were only a few papers and one take home test. As long as you gave a solid effort on each assignment it was not hard to get a high mark. The material of the course is also very eye opening.;
He gets angry at students from time to time, and I can\'t remember ever being on schedule in his class. He skips over some content in class (sometimes would ask TAs to make up for it in DGDs). The assignments are hard, but if you can do them you\'re good for the midterms. Exam was more challenging in addition to being entirely multiple choice.;
There are assignments every week, which although is a lot, only 240 of 310 possible points actually counts which leaves out 2-3 assignments. You only lose BONUS marks from him if you ask questions from a lecture 2 weeks ago. There are many practice quizzes at the DGDs to help you. He\'s a great prof and wants to help, but it\'s a difficult course.;
"Dr. Terry is thorough and thought provoking. You cover a good deal of ground in corporate finance in ""adv fin mgmt"". While the earlier courses are a little too easy, this course is really excellent. This course makes heavy use of case studies, an excellent immersive tool. Best time to ask him questions is during or after class.";
Gel is really a great teacher. Knows the material backwards and forwards but has a way with personalizing the material as well. She knows what it\'s like to be a student. Will certainly take more classes with her.;
Have taken many classes with Gel. She\'s highly recommended. If you want to learn how to dance, go to her.;
Such a great professor. I took this class for extra credit. Very much enjoyed it. Such a great teacher. Really knows what shes talking about.;
Anita is a nice person, but she generally has no idea what she is talking about and is usually completely unprepared for her lessons. The book actually tries to show you the content of the course, I have doubts if she has ever read it. Beware of her extreme problems with clarity and habits of assigning homework through email at random.;
The first half of the semester is on book material and the second half is doing a confusing as hell group project - it did not help that she missed so many days of class. The tests are somewhat difficult but if you read the book you should be good to go. Make sure to ask her questions outside of class because her instructions are often vague.;
Teacher very hard;
Super super easy class!!! There is hardly any homework in this class. Basically what you don\'t finish in class is your homework. She makes the assignments pretty short and easy. She doesn\'t grade hard at all. Just show up and do the assignments and group work (worth 20 points but super easy) then you will pass easily!;
"An honest (yet sometimes hard hitting) professor who excels at making you put effort into work at the things you need to accomplish for the class. Do not expect to go in for an ""Easy A"", and do not expect there to be special treatment. You do the work, you earn your grade. Whether it\'s good or bad, that\'s on you. Read. Don\'t mess around.";
She\'s nice, but a tough grader. You have to do all the work and keep up or you will fail.;
She\'s been an incredible mentor for not only me, but many others. She keeps her students in mind and updates on possible internshipsjobeducational opportunities. She has your back if you put the effort in--grades on development. LISTEN to her advice, and always ask questions. Don\'t be afraid to speak up. Hands-down, the best professor at OU.;
Dr. James is an awesome instructor. His tests are great, but beware of chronological order. As long as you try, you will be just fine. If you love history take his class. I\'ve had two classes with him and got an A both times.;
Dr. James, At first I was hesitant to take his class as I signed up for another professor but the class was split due to size. I am very glad I had Dr. James. His tests are long and he is a little disorganized at times but his lectures are fun and he is very passionate about history. Will make you work for your grade! Overall I really liked him.;
He is someone who I\'d call an intellectual. I could just sit down and listen to him talk about things he\'s passionate about. Very smart, funny, and gives great lectures. If you turn in a paper he marks grammatical errors and work cited mistakes. take good notes and refer to the book. You have to work for your grade but he makes it very enjoyable.;
His lectures are engaging. Best professor at Coastal. Prepares you for the exams by making the course fun and interesting.;
Dr. Roda is not at all the way most of these reviews make him sound. I don\'t know how much easier he could make it seeing as he gives you all the test and quiz questions ahead of time. He also offeres to help with any questions you have. In my experience he was a very nice enjoyable teacher.;
Dr. A is an amazing director. He will push you and others in the choir harder than any other director. You will learn how to make near flawless music for the purpose of delivering beautiful texts and messages. A once in a lifetime opportunity to work with a musician of his calibre.;
No Comments;
Very good professor and really consider students\' request. Test not hard but needs detailed reviews.;
She is a wonderful teacher and tells funny stories. She will do what she can to make sure you understand what she wants.;
Arlan is the best prof ever. He is so funny, knows his students by name, and it\'s clear to see that he wants his students to succeed. He cares about each student\'s progress and is full of knowledge and insight... there\'s so much to learn from this guy. If you have the chance to take a class with him, DO IT. 100% do it.;
Knows history and truly enjoys when students are engaged. This can be a really fun class. He talks about his stories and that annoyed some students, but I enjoyed listening to things I never knew about. If you want to learn, listen to what he says. Ask questions! He\'s very receptive to any questions;
"i really loved this professor!! He looked at the controversial issue/religion and man from all points of views. he brought the science into the religion by discussing the themes of social vs actual ailments. he was amazing! a great lecturer, very hot and unpretentious, very dramatic and moving, kept you intriuged with what he would do next. and i agree that ""he didn\'t take any crap from know-it-alls OR arrogant skeptics"". the essays were really hard, but it challenged your thinking.";
Lot of students wrote a negative review for saying that his lecture is dry but it\'s more like the topic is somewhat dry. The professor definitely goes above and beyond the textbook and teaches useful programs that are currently used in the MIS field. Really cares about his students & hw is challenging and makes you think. Gives generous extra crdit;
Mr. Shirani is one of the few teachers that gives out very helpful study guides so you know what to study for on the mid/final. 4-5 Homeworks assignments throughout the sem. no group projects. For mid/final study the study guide and in class exercise and you will do fine(write a good cheat sheet)You don\'t have too show up to class.;
Aurora is fantastic! Really cares about our projects and makes an effort to support us towards creating a fantastic final work.;
Great professor and amazing lecturer. Class consisted mainly of quizzes and papers. TA\'s do most of the grading.;
I took his speech class and I loved him! If you have any brain you should make an A. He\'s not a tough grader on the speeches because he understands that people are naturally better or worse speakers. You ARE on your own with the test because he doesn\'t cover anything in the book. Just read the chapters it\'s over and you\'ll do fine!;
super nice guy. really explains the matterial well. I just couldn\'t wrap my head around it.;
BvB is one of the best professors at GW. She has a love for Renaissance art, which is infectious. Her lectures are fascinating and clear, and she is a pretty easy grader. She really cares about her students, so it pays to get to know her. I have taken many classes with her and hope to take more. She is everything a student could ask for.;
BVB is the BEST. she\'s absolutely life-changing, and one of the leading experts in her field. so so brilliant. she\'s such a wonderful person who truly wants her students to do well & is willing to go above & beyond to help. Tests are hard so you need to put in the work and don\'t skip class. textbook is usually a CD of images that you will use;
She\'s my favorite art history professor! She\'s super sweet, is a practical professor. She doesn\'t make you remember dates which is awesome if you know art history classes. She\'s clear on her requirements and always accessible.;
Show up, review a bit, pass. It\'s that easy with such a brilliant professor as Bvb. No reading required, just a CD that is optional if you need help reviewing before the 3 tests. A visual analysis paper that should not be an issue if you spend some time on it. There might be a lot of material to memorize but Bvb curves a lot.;
Barry Cohen is one of the best computer science professors in NJIT. His use of class time is remarkable (except for the times when he goes off into tangents). He is very knowledgeable about the material, and his use of classroom assistants is definitely made to help students. I would highly recommend him.;
Great teacher, was able to learn. They provide labs that you need to do. Do those and you can basically pass.;
Professor Cohen is a great professor. Honestly, as long as you grasp the concepts of any programming language then translate them to the appropriate language that you\'re learning, you\'re good. There\'s a lot of homework, and the exams are all right, not too bad.;
Great teacher cares about students gives extra credit to boost grade. review for every exam. take him easy A. he will not stress you.;
Dr. Todd is very helpful and nice. ME 121 is a very easy class, so easy that basically if you show up to class, then you will pass. There are in class assignments everyday so it is important to show up. The only work really outside of class is the 10 minute homeworks on Blackboard, and the two professional society meetings for credit.;
"Professor Zacate\'s class is very easy and it is chock-full of extra credit. However, she doesn\'t teach very well and makes students do online ""tutorial quizzes"" about the book\'s content. You can keep redoing them until you get it right. She also seems to get flustered at any questions that doesn\'t fit right into her framework.";
Good professor. Has an accent but its easy to get over. Fair grader, simple quizzes. Really makes sure you understand the material.;
Great teacher! Easy to follow & understand. Show up, take notes, do the optional hw, and you will pass with an A. Quiz every week, helps you to know material and prepares you for the 2 exams. Funny, when you least expect it. Would take another math class with him as my teacher! EC at the end of semester if you come to class everyday.;
Great!;
His accent is easy to get used to. He does have a sense of humor. Homework is not graded and he only suggests 15-20 problems each week. Quizzes are once a week as well but they are max 3-5 questions and exactly from the homework. Exams are based on the quizzes. If you hate math-take him! Lectures are simple and to the point-he is a great teacher!;
I\'ve always hated math and have only been average at it, but Professor Wang makes it so easy and straightforward! His class was a really easy A, and like I said, I\'m not great at math. He\'s also super cute like he makes jokes, is passionate about math, and is overall very likable :) Would definitely take him again.;
Amazing professor. Class was easy to follow. Took it online and he included lectures every week to go along with the reading. Usually his lectures helped so much I didn\'t have to read the book. Easy to get in contact with, super helpful, and responds quickly.;
Awesome professor who made Economics lectures interesting. I was well-prepared for exams and all information tested on was covered during class lectures in detail.;
Great lectures, homework assigned helps with studying for tests. Practice quizzes were similar to tests. He responds to emails within the same day.;
I enjoyed Sorem\'s teaching style and clear cut expectations. He actually reads your posts and provides you with specific feedback. I would take him in a heartbeat! Who knew I would love Econ. Thanks Prof!;
I thoroughly enjoyed my Econ 110 class with Sorem. He\'s very knowledgeable about his subject, and goes into great detail about what he wants you to learn and take out of his lectures. He\'ll emphasize what he wants you to get out of his learning, and the parts you need to focus on.;
This economics class was a solid choice, for the most part. His online readings were very clear and had good insights into economics. However, He makes you do at least one exam in-person at the testing center. His two online exams were all multiple choice except for a few calculations. His in-person exam was all short answer and was quite harder.;
He\'s more of a stand and talk kind of guy. His handwriting can get a bit messy to read;
I took Dr. Bob\'s class because all of his amazing reviews- and he is now easily my favorite professor I\'ve ever had. He is so knowledgable and this was one of those classes you will never forget. He has the best stories and his lectures are amazing. Tests are a little long (few short answer questions) but as long as you take notes, you\'ll be fine!;
My favorite professor at Highline! He cares more about the students actually getting and understanding the information. He gives feedback on all returned papers, and he always has them graded within two days. Really cares about his students.;
As someone who is downright scared of public speaking, I found his class to be very welcoming and helpful. I learned tons of pointers and figured out how to make my speeches concise and effective. Professor Betts made my four week Summer speech course bearable by being a helpful, friendly guy. He is to-the-point but not harsh. Great guy.;
I was always so scared of public speaking, but Bob Betts creates a classroom environment that takes away that anxiety. He grades on content, not nervous ticks or memorization. Super enjoyable class with fun assignments. I would recommend to anyone taking a speech class.;
Mr. Betts is really into helping students become all they are capable of. I\'m a shy person and hate public speaking;
Research is key to good grade. Make sure to show up, be on time, and take notes as best you can. He loves class participation and questions and is very accessible via email and office hours. He didn\'t assign much in textbook, but if you take the time to read the related chapters, you will have a solid advantage.;
Show up, do your research, and you\'ll do well;
Great Prof. Who\'s knowledge is second hand to none so far of those who I\'ve met so far in my life. Grading scale is clear. Will stay as long as you need after class to help you on ANYTHING you need. Even offers to help students with other classes if he can. I\'ve had him for a couple classes, I\'ve learned a lot from him.;

As a student that usually struggles with math, Professor Young was great. I took him online, he makes instructional videos for every lesson that are a huge help. You can tell that he genuinely loves math and he explains it in a way that\'s easy for anyone to understand.;
He teaches like a kid that is excited for a present on Christmas but it makes a usually dull subject engaging. I had him in the morning and he was almost better than coffee for waking me up.;
I am terrible at math, yet I finished this course with an A. This was an online course - all assignments were open from day 1 of the semester so that students could work ahead. Extra credit opportunities for every tests. Professor Young WANTS his students to succeed. If you struggle in math, he will get you through!;
I did not know what to expect going into this course however, Mr. Young did an outstanding job utilizing Canvas and MYMathLab to give his students a clear expectation even before stepping into his class. There are plenty of resources available, I am not the most confident student in math but he brings of the best in his students. Take his class!!!!;
Mr. Young is an exceptional teacher. He takes an interest in all of his students and goes out of his way to help you. He really makes math a fun experience. His class is the most social and friendly math class I ever took. Mr. Young gives extra credit opportunities, math handouts, and videos. I would recommend him to any student wanting to succeed.;
Young is amazing! I suck at math but I got an A in this class (after getting a C in intermediate algebra which was taken online with an instructor that didn\'t always respond to requests for help in time for the test). For me, the A took quite a bit of intense work. Generous extra credit and fabulous DIY lecture videos were very much appreciated!;
Brad is a great teacher and a true professional. He is very approachable so do not hesitate to go see him if you are having a hard time. His lectures are interesting and well put together. His tests are difficult if you do not follow his review outline. I really enjoyed my experience with him as a prof.;
Brandie has the highest expectations of any prof I\'ve had at BYU. She makes you earn every single point on tests, papers, and participation. Getting an A from her is a real challenge. BUT she\'s the best prof I\'ve had. I learned SO MUCH from her and will take every class I can from her in the future. If you really care about your edu, take Brandie;
Brett is a really nice and fun professor. He cares a lot about this subject (forensics) and lectures were always really interesting to me. His class consists of just 4 projects and a final. The projects are challenging and can be time consuming, but they are overall fair. He does a good job of helping you out if you need it.;
"If you get lost during the class you can resort to writing BG quotes in your margins..such as: ""I\'m good at geography!"" or ""Not everyone goes around saying \'I\'m an Incritite!"" or ""I am not sure of the Catholic doctrine of what happend when the food and wine is digested."" He has a puzzling dislike for pentacostals though...";
Best English professor ever, Very thoughtful. An easy A. Take this class if you want become a better writer.;
He is a great and knowledgeable professor. All the bad comments are from students who are just lazy and are trying to get a good grade without putting any effort.;
He is very funny. I would take him again.;
He is very smart, very knowledgeable and easy with the homework. And he was generous when it came down to curving test grades.;
Professor Potter was impersonal, was weeks/ months late in grading assignments, and was extremely disorganized. If not for what I knew from high school, I would not have passed this class. Over half of the students dropped out. I learned how to guess my way through unclear assignments and how to use his last-minute feedback in my prepared essays.;
Professor Rose was the only professor my first semester who really challenged me. His lectures are consistently engaging but he expects a lot from each of his students. If you think you can meet some high expectations, take his class. He\'s extremely helpful, very clear in what he wants, and very passionate and knowledgeable about what he\'s teaching;
Can\'t recommend him enough! Go for it.;
"His test have nothing to do with what he leactures about (if you can call it lecturing). Our final was about 112 question long. He tries to ""Stand and Deliver"" the class, but fails miserably. There is no organization! This class is not hard, but it adds so much stress to your life. You\'re basically in limbo the whole time with your grade. Stay away";
It\'s a really confusing class at first. but once you get used to it, it\'s really fun. I learned a lot, most of it self directed. I learned how to be more inquisitive and self reliant. I enjoyed his class. There are no tests, but homework is due every class.;
Prof Leatham teaches in a way in which you learn or you don\'t. From the very beginning he makes it known you control your own grade. Lots to read but most readings are interesting. His style is relaxed, honest, invigorating, and he\'s most definitely a giver. Pays close attention to detail and is forgiving of fault. Hands down, def one of the best.;
Professor Leatham is not your typical professor. He talks a lot during his lectures but he makes it fun and interesting. He had two exams and they were based on his lectures and on the readings. His exams were 10% of our grade. He gave A LOT of extra credit!;
"Very strange man. I felt the class was a colossal waste of time. He will go on a rant for an hour straight everyday of class. Just very tiring on the ears after a few weeks. Wants you to learn on your own but the ""material"" is non-existent. Basically you spend this class\'s work time on Google and Wikipedia.";
Very open-minded and articulate. He\'ll be there for you when you need it.;
I had Hammond for Micro in fall term 2016 and Macro in winter term 2017. I thought he was a good prof and was able to get good marks in both classes. However, after a year, it looks like that has all changed as I was reading all the comments for the fall 2017 micro term. Just goes to show how classes/profs can differ year to year. Just be careful;
Great teacher.. Just listen and do your work;
I didn\'t realize the course would include a mandatory MLM presentation by a snake oil salesman for a product based on inaccurate nutrition information from a veterinarian. He pitches his other classes all the time and tries to bribe you to take them by offering extra credit in this course. He treats adults like children, and don\'t be late!;
LOVED this class! I recommend it to EVERYONE with this prof! He teaches things beyond the textbook and has helped me with life skills.;
Nice guy. You must attend every class bc there\'s always something relevant to learn each day. Need the textbook (I only used the workbook for the review or the final). 5 exams, 1 practical (group) exam, lowest grade is dropped (can\'t drop the final). Lectures are boring. Lots of hands-on stuff. Lots of classmate interactions. Good class take!;
Professor Martin really enjoys the subject of stress management. The techniques he taught in class really work and can help, they helped me a lot during Finals week. Do the extra credit and online homework nd study and you\'ll get an easy A.;
Show up for class do all your assignments and any extra credit that is offered. Make sure you study the power point presentation and the word definitions that are listed in the chapters. If you do those steps you will pass the class with no problem. Make sure you are on time for class. Once the door is close we will not be allowed in the class;
Best professor I\'ve had at UVU. If you show up, pay attention, participate, and read you\'ll learn a lot and get a good grade.;
She is a very good english teacher. I had her twice, The grade you work for will be the grade that you earn;
Camillo is easily the greatest communication teacher of all time period. He will be hard on you but it\'s for your own good. If you can\'t take Camillo, change your major because it gets no better than this.;
Camilo was a great teacher. I enjoyed his class a lot. It was just a lecture but I learned a lot. His accent is thick but if you try you can understand him. He even sat down with me and outlined my entire class course for the rest of my Dutchess career. Just show up to class and do the work, you\'ll pass. If you ask for help its there Funny guy too;
I\'ve had Camilo throughout my two years at Dutchess and its simple. Go to class, listen in lecture, take the critique and you wont have a problem. Although you may feel that you\'re not learning anything in lecture, pay attention because it all will pay off.;
She is the best professor I ever had in my life! Great personality and very knowledgeable! Respectful to students and very helpful. Even if you were not perfect but were working hard she will give you great grade! I love her so much!!!!;
She is the best professor I ever had in my life! Great personality and very knowledgeable! Very respectful, professional and helpful. Even if you were not perfect but were working hard she will give you great grade! She is my favorite professor and absolutely recommend her class!!!;
Adult humor kind of teacher. Gave you many chances to get things right and turn them in. Easy A.;
Awesome professor! Really easy class just take notes and listen. Definitely would take her again if possible!;
I would retake this course a million times !! Tops explains everything very well and is always making us laugh. She is willing to work with you if your grade is struggling (which is unlikely) and is almost always available outside of the classroom.;
"Professor Topping ""Top"" is so hilarious, kind, and knows her stuff. You wont find yourself with any questions that she cant answer about psychology! Her class will be entertaining and before you realize it, the semester has flown by and you have learned so much more than you probably expected.";
wonderful professor. Makes class interesting and fun.;
She is a terrible teacher. She picks favorites and marks you according if she likes you or not. She has no idea on what she is teaching. She needs to learn more about children before she teaches others.;
Prof Perry is a very unorganized but she makes up for it with a lot of extra credit. I can honestly say that if you study what she gives in her study guides then you should be good. She didn\'t require finals for people who have 96% and above and trust me, I had like a 103% cause of the extra credit.;
Absolutely the most caring and knowledgeable professor I have ever had! Boy! Does he know how to teach!;
Devastatingly handsome. But mostly a great professor, who cares a lot about his students. Make sure to speak up during critique!;
Funny guy, really smart. If you\'re naturally good at math this class won\'t be too bad. I would avoid skipping as he covers about a section a lecture. Homework is tough, but the quizzes and exams are quite easy.;
It\'s not an easy class, but he definitely helps. The homework problems are very similar to those on the quizzes and tests.;
She is a great professor that will go out of her way to help you. Class is interesting, however, there are some concepts that are hard to grasp. There really isn\'t much homework at all, other than reading the chapters from the book. There are 3 quizzes and a final, but the final is just questions from the 3 quizzes. Read, Go to class and take notes;
She thinks she\'s a good professor but her lectures are utterly pointless. She\'s confusing and goes off on tangents that are irrelevant to the class material. I would probably look for a different professor in retrospect because, although I received an A, it was a stressful 100 level class and I learned nothing.;
I liked the way she taught we got written and oral credit. It was a lot of worl but it was all well worth it.;
Only grades in the class are 3 exams. Tests are easy if you take notes and study. Tests are 35 multiple choice. Gives a few extra credit points if you go to class. She shows several movies and has several guest speakers. Great class and great professor. Would absolutely take again! Attendance not mandatory and textbook not needed;
I love Mrs. D! She\'s so nice and really knows her singing techniques. Join chorale :D;
I was very uneasy as to how grading will be and I cannot lie, waiting for my grade made me very anxious. As a professor, def not the best. As an advisor, he is phenomenal and keeps things real. Unless you\'re ready to be fully engaged I would avoid taking him but he is great to talk to!;
Dr. Kelley is extremely clear if you would open your ears and pay attention. Yes, just like every class, you need to go over notes and study. His exams are on par with what he teaches. Unfortunately A+ isn\'t an option in this school, but an A is just as good here. He has a great personality and always willing to help if you need it.;
Orgo with Dr. Kelley is great, he is such a smart man and know just about everything there is to know about orgo. If you don\'t show up to class then I would suggest watching the lectures. If you don\'t do either then you\'re going to have a hard time trying to pass this class. The masteringChemistry homework helps! Do it!;
DO NOT BE LATE TO CLASS! If you are going to be late: Just go to the UC. You\'ll get your feelings hurt if you walk in late. Papers must include what he wanted you to talk about (even though he didn\'t clarify this before you turned it in) Grading is not fair. Just says to try harder next time. Read all the text book and understand it for test.;
One of the best professors I have ever had. If something was not understood, he stops and makes sure that everyone understands before moving on. He actually teaches instead of lectures.;
Dr Boucher is super personable and nice. His history lectures are interesting, even thoough I\'m not a huge fan of European history. He\'s really funny as well. You definitely need to read the books he assigns as you have quizzes on them, but for the most part there\'s not much quizzing on stuff he posts online unless he talks about it in class.;
He is SO funny and so kind. His class is so much fun even if science doesn\'t interest you. His lectures are never boring and as long as you come to class and pay attention the exams are really easy. Great guy!;
One of my favorite professors so far! Dobson does a great job engaging students and seems to get everyone excited to learn. Science has never been my favorite subject, but this has so far been my favorite class I have ever taken. Even for an 8am class, I never wanted to skip because there was so much material covered and class was very interesting.;
One of the most knowledgeable and helpful professors I have had at Grand Valley! I would recommend taking any class that he teaches!;
He\'s a good teacher and is really cool. He is hilarious and class is normally fun.;
Hoyt will have you read at least 25 pages for every class, however you will only ever get through about 2 pages worth of discussion. Rambles on and on. When asking questions is searching for something so specific he just keeps asking people until he gets close or we run out of time.;
This course was engaging and Prof. Hoyt is very well prepared for class. Make sure to read everything he tells you to read, it will help you with the pop quizzes. As long as you stay on top of things, you will do great in this course. Prof. Hoyt is also very understanding and cares about your opinions and thoughts.;
DO: Take this class if you want to learn the language. No other profesor compares. DON\'T: Take this class if you just need to pass because you must work very hard.;
I like her a lot. She\'s very helpful.;
Take Science Fiction and Fantasy Lit!!! Jackson is soo incredibly helpful!! She gives so much feedback and will reply to any and all emails in a very timely manner. There are quizzes almost every class, but you just need to read to pass! Its very easy! The essays and thesis proofs are not bad as well! YOU WATCH MOVIES TOO! VERY interesting class!!;
Chuck is a great professor, he frequently leaves the country so classes are sparse, and his grading sometimes can be questionable. If you do the assignments and answer the questions you\'ll get an A with no questions asked. He\'s a very respectable man and probably one of the nicest people you\'ll ever meet.;
Very laid back, and cancels class frequently. Weekly papers are easy, and no exams. Class isn\'t that bad (when you have it);
Mrs. Herbert is amazing! If you show up to class, pay attention, and do the work, you will at least pass, if not get a great grade. She\'s enjoyable and relational. Fantastic teacher!;
Professor Herbert is by far my favorite professor I have ever had (online or in a classroom). She was extremely helpful and truly cared that her students understood the materials. She also made it to where success was easy IF you put in the work. I appreciated her teaching style very much and would definitely recommend her as a professor.;
She teaches straight from the book but she will go over it in class before you attempt it just in case the book was not clear enough. the actual class and material were easy and she simplified it even more. Great Teacher.;
This class is really easy. You do an in class assignment and then you do the exact same thing in an application. I reccomend this class to everyone. I missed literally 7 points in the whole entire class and the class has like 2970 points. Plus you learn some great things about excel, word, PowerPoint, and access that will help you in live.;
Corinn Columpar was the best cinema studies professor I had at the University of Toronto. She is very confident in her understanding of film theory and she elucidates her thoughts eloquently and efficiently. She made me see film in an entirely new way and I\'m grateful for the perspective she gave me. Take her classes.;
Not easy grades but definitely fair. If you study and do the weekly readings you will easily get an 80+ (unless you aren\'t good at writing papers). Prof has excellent lectures. Easily the best lecturer I had in my first year. Sums up the readings really, gives great examples, and is very clear with concepts she is trying to explain.;
Prof. Columpar is a great lecturer. Very engaging, and able to explain important concepts clearly. Eclectic choice of screening material: there\'ll be something for everyone! Tests, exams, and assignments aren\'t easy, but they are fair. If you\'re willing to do the readings, attend lectures, and put the work in you should do well.;
she is the best professor I\'ve ever seen. her lectures are so organised and clear excluding using too many ornate vocabs.;
She\'s overall a good teacher, but it\'s really distracting and irritating when she uses a lot of obscure words, especially since I\'ve heard her use those words incorrectly or mispronounced them.;

Craig is an awesome teacher! You can really tell he is passionate about what he teaches. Also the class is a bit hard (10+ exams) but there is so much extra credit you can still pass with a good grade. You also do go outside a lot but it\'s a lot of fun! This was my Favorite class & professor and I wish I could take it again.;
Craig Stettner is awesome! I did not want to take a science class at all, but he definitely made it worth my while. He offers so much extra credit (over 100 points)! I got D\'s on tests, but still ended with an A in the class. Every lecture he gives you exercises which are nice grade boosters. Expect to go outside. Craig is really nice and helpful!;
Zoology was the best course I\'ve taken so far across 3 different colleges. It wasn\'t difficult to pass at all, was extremely interesting & the classroom is loaded with specimens. Craig is an amazing professor and just a pleasant person to be around in general. Dress for the weather, as you should be prepared for outdoor excursions at any time!;
This is the second class I\'ve taken with Craig and I have learned so much. He is a tough grader, but the very nature of sculpture is difficult. If your hard work is apparent, he will notice, but you have to really try to get an A in his class. Attendance is mandatory, like all studio classes, and final documentation is also a big part of your grade;
Good professor. Not very clear with what she wants so you may need to ask a few times to get the answer. Lots of papers, so you better like to write. You need to set aside at least an hour a night to get an A. It\'s possible, but tough.;
Professor Maguire is a smart and kind person. She goes above and beyond her everyday teaching responsibilities to make sure every student is successful during the semester. But she is not a pushover.;
Cynthia doesn\'t play, she expects you to pre-read the material before coming to class each day. Then in class she expects participation. She will ask you questions. She tries to guide u to the answer but is often confusing how she does it. She was very helpful outside of class. She seems intimidating but is truly a kind soul. Ask & she will help.;
Cynthia will see you for what you are. Don\'t take her classes if they\'re a check in the box for your degree program. But if you\'re passionate, and actually care about the subject matter, Cynthia is an incredible leader help you realize your goals. She WILL let you know if you aren\'t cut out for the field. Which is a much needed trait in a teacher;
I loved Cynthia and the way she taught her class. She lets you know she\'s there for you the whole way through. You definitely won\'t float through cell biology because it\'s not an easy subject but if you do the work as she suggests and participate in class you\'ll be fine. She\'s so passionate about what she teaches, a truly awesome professor.;
Professor Schauer is a passionate, compassionate person. She is patient beyond measure and helps students succeed. She fosters a place of learning, not just spitting out the right answers. Schauer encourages questions, not just perfection. She takes classes out of her profession so she understands being clueless!Awesome person in and out of class!;
Great;
Professor Cody is proficient at what he does and his method of teaching is excellent. He uses powerpoints and practice questions. He ensures that the class has complete understanding of each topic before proceeding to the next. He gives assignment for each chapter in an effort to make us practice and review the material on our personal time.;
I\'m taking her children\'s lit class right now. She\'s very interesting and tries hard to keep the class interested and attentive.;
Dr. Fonseca has an interesting teaching style. Maybe it\'s the fact that this course is 4 courses in 1, but it was very quick and sometimes hard to keep up with. Despite that, Dan the man is a very effective teacher. All the grades you receive are essential, but it\'s not hard to make an A. None of the tests are cumulative, not even the final;
Good guy and some funny jokes during his lectures. Took him for G208 and it was an easy A.;
Professor Knudsen is one of the most experienced and brilliant faculty in the IU Geography Department (perhaps in the entire university). His research spans many many sub-fields of the discipline. He teaches courses on food geography and theory. However, the courses I took with him involved industrial and economic geography. He is versatile!;
Great professor! The key to getting a good grade in this class is really just paying attention to his lectures, taking good notes, and studying. He makes all the neuroscience material understandable with the way he explains things. He also always provides real-life examples relating to the lecture and they\'re enjoyable to listen to bc he\'s funny.;
The tests can be difficult, but he prepares you well via in class lectures. He keeps the lectures engaging by constantly sharing anecdotes and telling jokes. Attendance is only 4% of the grade, but if you don\'t come to class, be prepared to fail.;
Defiantly the best professor I\'ve had for GEN chem. But the class is still hard. I got an A using Study Edge. They really help to explain and emphasize the most important things Talham goes over. 100% recommend going to the weekly review sessions with Study edge made a huge difference when it came to the exams.;
He is a super nice guy and want the best for his class. That being said if you go to his Office hours he turns into a mean person and kinda judges you. But other than that he was awesome and would def recommend him.;
I loved his lecture style! It\'s frustrating when professors put up slides and expect you to just copy them down while talking fast. Dr. Talham put slides up AND wrote items down on the board AND explained as he went. Lots of great visual aids in class. He made a note to learn every student\'s name in class during Summer A. Kind guy, great lecturer;
Professor Talham is the best! He\'s a cool guy who knows how to make Chemistry interesting, and a hard class accessible to students. He presents the subject matter in a clear and concise manner and even hand writes the notes along with his students, so you never miss anything because the professor is going too fast. Would take again!;
Talham went to chemistry seminars around the world, in his absence the TA would take over the course. The TA sucked at lecturing. Talhams lectures are very interesting though. He doesn\'t use power points. I finished with an 83, which is an A. One Important thing;
He is the best, for students who want to study. If you are lazy please take someone else. I took him online this semester spt2013 all I had to do is do what he asked and I received an A. Thank you or an interesting semester professor Vona.;
The best English teacher at NACC. Dr. Huntley is funny, intelligent, thorough, and interesting. If you hate English like me, take her;
wow. this guy is great! first class with him, love the class, love the prof. learning a ton without a lot of buys work. best class ive ever had.;
SOOOO CUTE! I LOVED his classes, even tho they were early, i never missed a chance to hear him lecture. so smart and willing to help. definitely take as many classes as possible with him!;
I am glad he was my Capstone professor because I enjoyed his class so much. Most of the class involves group work, so find good partners on the first day. His personality is something you have to be prepared for, as he can be a little abrasive to sensitive people. Sometimes assignment reqs were unclear but he does everything to help you understand.;
He\'s s great professor who genuinely cares about his students. He talks to people who talk to him so that can sometimes be misconstrued as favoritism. He teaches organic, a difficult subject very well. He\'s real and does not beat around the bush, which is nice.;
There\'s a quip a minute as Professor Handschuh does his standup in front of the class, but what you don\'t realize is how much you are learning about Journalism, Photojournalism, the business of Journalism and the continuing need to keep up with the technology. David truly cares about the students and you\'d be fortunate to get into his class.;
No Comments;
David is a good teacher. He knows how to make the subject sound interesting, no matter what it is. He also has really good stories to tell. If you have an opportunity to take a class with him, do it. You won\'t regret it. The only homework he assigns is reading 1-3 chapters a week and a weekly online discussion. The final was open book, open note.;
Great professor and has interesting lectures. Although he lacks group projects and even though his lectures are interesting, if you don\'t love listening to lectures they can get kinda boring. TIP: for the test, go to his lecture notes on canvas and hit Ctrl+F on your keyboard. It\'s an open test so you can do word search on notes to get the answers.;
He\'s a really nice teacher. He really cares about the students.;
Hyde is a really cool guy and always has interesting stories to share. He is super smart and intellectual to the point where it\'s kind of intimidating. Some of the time when people raised their hands he would kind of shut down their ideas but for the most part he is really nice. Super easy homework. He takes attendance once a week.;
Hyde is by far the best professor I\'ve had at SPSCC. His criminology class was extremely interesting and I learned a lot from him! The lectures could sometimes be dull but he would tend to tell personal stories to liven things up. The homework load was minimal and we hardly ever used the book in class. You need to take a class with Hyde!;
Hyde is probably my favorite professor at SPSCC. He\'s interesting, engaging, and knows what the hell he\'s talking about. His stories spice up his lectures and the information he shares is really interesting. I learned more in the classes I took with Hyde than in any other classes. And it was incredibly easy. If you\'re on the fence, do it.;
I took Hyde\'s Global Sociology class because my previously selected class was canceled. He even wrote the textbook for the class (plus it\'s free file he gives out for download) I had him for Criminology a few quarters ago too and it was very interesting. Some very crazy stories from his life, and a very friendly guy overall.;
Lectures can get a bit boring, but he adds in really amusing stories about his life to help lighten things up. Minimal homework;
LOVED HIM. He rocks, so nice. He\'s kind of awkward but the best type of awkward. Saw him downtown Oly so that\'s cool. He is opinionated but doesn\'t force his ideas on you. I liked him.;
This is my second quarter with Hyde. His class is easy, but heavy on lectures. There are no tests and the only assignments are weekly discussion posts and a final paper. Its pretty easy, and an interesting class.;
There are few teachers that trully make a difference in students\' lives;
I took him twice. I felt the difficulty of his class was fair, The exams were short answer and multiple choice. The daily quizzes he gives, do help you papare for the exams. His grading criteria is clearly laid out. If you do the homework, you should be able to pass the class with no issuies.;
Loved this class. No nonsense approach to teaching - conveys the critical information and explains its significance and application. Would take Labour Law again with him in heartbeat!;
Dr. Perkins is the best professor I have had at ACU. I am currently a MAcc student and he still goes back and reviews the basics with us. He believes strongly in understanding the fundamentals of accounting. His class is not hard if you pay attention in class and do the homework. He also makes himself very available to his students.;
A caring, loving, easy going, and funny/ He is by far a great teachers there no way to fail his class no WAY............;
David really cares about his students and their success. He does require lots of reading, but it is all very interesting. If you love history you like this class. He does have lots of papers but most of them are 1 page papers. He has options to do service learning or outside learning for extra credit and allows revisions of papers. Amazing teacher!;
Dr. Rayson was, by far the best professor I had in my time at Normandale. He is truly inspired me to do better in each assignment i handed in. His tests are essays in which you will know about weeks in advance. He allows revisions to these essays until you get the grade you want. I highly recomend this instructor to anyone.;
He\'s very understanding and an overall great person. He cares for the students;
I loved David\'s class. Ancient history usually isn\'t my thing, but he found subjects that could spark students interest. He is very supportive of his students, and occasionally goes on little rants about how WE are in charge of our education, not the other way around, and actually told us to come here to do research on our professors. Really great!;
Prepare for a lot of writing. David is an excellent professor, and is very dedicated to the teaching profession.;
Super funny and nice guy. His class is pretty easy and you can retake your assignments.;
Take him he\'s an amazing teacher. I got an A and did moderate work. You also learn a lot from him. Like others said he is funny too and has a good personality.;
Professor Karras is stern and speaks in a monotone manner. He didn\'t show much of his personality. He\'s a reserved, fair guy. Pick your karate partner wisely because you\'ll be stuck with them all semester. My partner had a nice body so you know I was chillin :^D There\'s no flying kicks in this class. It\'s mostly defensive grappling maneuvers;
Solid professor, Attendance & Lateness is key. Get there on time and pay attention, you\'ll be fine. Not the best but not the worst either.;
Theirs a written midterm which he basically tell you all the answers to the class before and a final. for the final you have to perform all the moves you learned through the semester. I thought I was going fail because I could never remember any of the moves from the class before but he let us record him doing the moves & i ended up getting an A;
No Comments;
She was brilliantly insightful and went out of her way to make her students feel valuable. A difficult class, yes, but untimely useful for future classes.;
Pluss is hysterical and made COMM Research Methods bearable. There are no surprises here and the final is just the four quizzes she gave throughout the semester. Of those four, she drops the lowest one. There were 5 assignments, 5 quizzes (including the final). The material can be dry but that\'s not on her. she made a boring class fun, take her.;
"Prof. Pluss is sweet and upbeat. Her ""quizzes"" are about 40 questions. However she does drop the lowest of the 4. There is a group project and a final project. Easy A if you study for the quizzes.";
Great teacher, great lecturer. You can tell she lives and breathes the material, which is pretty inspiring. Loved her class. Too bad she doesn\'t teach Political Theory on the regular.;
Love this professor! She\'s a little disorganized, but it\'s not too bad because she\'s super lenient on assignments and always very helpful. She\'s so passionate about the material, which really engages you. She is the type of professor you will remember years down the road when you look back at your education. Take this professor! You\'ll learn a lot.;
Probably one of the best educational experiences I\'ve ever had. I wanted to applaud after every lecture. Great teacher if you actually give a crap about trying to learn the material.;
Great professor! Very enthusiastic and cares about her students. She is so genuine and nice. I hate history so this class was boring for me but very easy. Her tests are easy if you go to the review. She tells you whats going to be on the test the class before the test. She doesn\'t give out 100 on her essays but its ok. Overall great woman :);
O\'shea is a easy professor is you do all of the online work, she\'s rude when you try to approach her outside of class. Her power points aren\'t very helpful, and her lectures do not help at all. Her directions when writing papers are very clear, but it is still difficult to receive a good score on them. The work is all online (quizzes and essays).;
O\'shea is an easy professor if you already know how to write a paper and able to commit your whole life to her class. Her in-class powerpoints and lecture does not match causing you to choose between what she is saying and her slide to take notes. However, its an easy A because its all online. I never went to class and ended with a A.;
She is a very good professor, funny, and really knows what she is talking about. Be ready to write several papers with vague guidelines.;
She was the best history teacher I\'ve ever had in my life! She was fair in her grading and even gave us extra credit multiple times. I usually am not good at history but her lectures were actually so interesting. She captures your attention and if you go to class she helps you understand the essay prompts and suggests general ideas.;
The questions for the papers are poorly defined and can lead to a lot of confusion when writing them. Fair grader. Very boring class, you have to read the book online so there is very little reason to go to her class.;
The best class I\'ve taken so far! GREAT person, great teacher.;
Great professor, explains everything with clarity. Literally what he talks about in class that\'s on the test. I would take him again.;
His class isn\'t hard, just really easy to get bored. As long as you know your terms and definitions you\'ll be fine. He doesn\'t like making things too difficult so the bare minimum is how his classes are set up.;
This class was way easier than I thought, he lays out clear guidelines for what you need to do to pass, and let\'s you decide how you will do. Every week he has a quiz, which you must be present for to be able to get your points (that build up to an A), but as long as your getting a decent grade, you can leave early. He is very willing to help.;
Johnston is the sort of teacher that probably should have retired twenty years ago. His classes are great if you want to listen to him complain about his personal life for an hour and a half, but if you actually want to learn something, you better find another teacher. He doesn\'t have clear grades and isn\'t very articulate either.;
Prof Richardson teaches this Global Health class from his personal perspective of opening a health clinic in Africa. He has a lot of experience and makes it super cool to listen to. You will know more about neglected diseases than you ever wanted to but you\'ll love it! He really cares about the students and wants you to do well. Hard but worth it.;
As an English major, I absolutely adored Dr. Harding. His classes were intellectually stimulating and I always felt challenged to understand literature in a more in-depth way. Dr. Harding offers students the opportunity to revise papers, gives students incredible feedback, and makes his class very interactive.;
She\'s freaking awesome!! She\'s super enthusiastic, so there\'s never a dull moment. She seems to really care about her students. I really enjoy her class and would recommend her to anyone.;
Amazing professor! I failed 2 tests (my fault for not studying) and I still passed the class with an A! She gives extra credit and makes biology easy to understand. Definitely would recommend anyone to take her;
I have never been able to understand this subject until I took her class. She offers Extra Credit questions on Exams, making it much easier to get a higher score. Very clear and straight forward and is always willing to help if you go to her for it. Overall you could not ask for a better Professor! Highly recommended!;
I loved her class. I was very engaged throughout the entire semester. The class format is very straight forward and she gives some extra credit. The gives review sessions before each test which are very helpful. I highly recommend her for any class.;
I loved this class and this professor. It was a hybrid class, which meant we only came in once a week for labs, and learned the lecture material ourselves. I was pretty worried about the labs and dissections but they were actually pretty easy. The lecture material isn\'t too hard to grasp if you read the book. Great class she offers extra credit!;
Our class was a 3hour lecture(T)/Lab(TH). At first those lectures were rough but Dilek is really passionate, she makes jokes, shows us videos, & keeps class interesting. Dilek accommodates to her students! I was really struggling but she took the extra time to additionally help me & adjust to my learning style. Dilek is an amazing professor!;
Prof. Dilek was awesome! She teaches botany in a way that is easy to learn, supplementing her lectures with videos and relevant HW assignments. She offers extra credit and puts some into each test too. Just study her study guides and you will be fine. Labs were fun and creative. Would take her for any class she offers!;
She\'s an amazing professor. As long as you study her notes you\'ll do fine on the tests;
Very nice teacher. Liked her a lot. Would definitely recommend taking the class.;
Tough but fair and willing to help but you gotta ask.;
"By the end of the semester, everyone loved her. Dr. Long is a great teacher. She loves her field, and she loves teaching those who also care about it. Just be respectful and you\'ll do fine. Also, never forget the space in ""a lot.""";
She loves the subject and that passion filters through into the students and makes them care about english and writing and has them want to learn English in this new light.;
Boring. Didnt really stimulate my thinking. Read material straight off powerpoints. Nice guy, but bored me. Class is relatively easy.;
Professor Lee stated from the first class that she is a strict professor. However, sometimes she is unclear with what she expects. Her discussions were interesting (although sometimes irrelevant from the topic, but the time go by faster). Her class is easy to pass if you do the work and ask questions when her instructions aren\'t clear.;
Dr. Shingle is a very nice woman but not a good teacher, in my opinion. She is very intelligent so the way she explains the information can be extremely confusing. You can ask questions but her answer isn\'t always clear. I\'m naturally a strong student so I did well, but people who aren\'t generally strong students struggled in the class.;
Lady is impossible. Lectures are ALL over the place. She doesn\'t teach the material clearly AT ALL. In fact, the online quizzes look foreign since you learn nothing in her class. It\'s actually really annoying. If you email her to asked for clarity, be prepared for a 3 word answer and no explanation. You need to read the book, to understand.;
A down to earth, approachable, fun, super nice guy. Still works as an administrator. Has lots of stories to tell. Open discussions can be engaging. There is some paper writing but it\'s well within reason. Gives options for the final project which was appreciated.;
easy grader;
Sure he might be a bit rough, but he explains the ins and outs of design. From Sequence Diagrams, Use Cases to Screen Designs. He\'s able to point the flaws and mistakes when you submit a document.;
He treats his upper division students the way they should be treated. Tough but flexible, and he KNOWS what is useful and what isn\'t--which is great. Hard to find him one on one since he\'s busy.;
Class seems easy. Attendance and Edmodo count a lot. Does not allow, food, gum, cell phones, nor drinks in the classroom, not even if its a 3hr long period. Other than that class is not that bad. her tests can be hard, but if you look over the chapter and notes, test should not be too hard. She would send out a review for the test, pretty helpful;
Hays is a very serious professor. As long as you don\'t eat or drink something other than water, she will like you. You should NEVER use your phone in her class or she will call you out. She lets you make up lost points for assignments as long as you turn them in on time. Make sure you come to class because Edmodo is a large part of your grade!;
Mrs. Hays is a very sweet lady. She seems to genuinely care about everyone, and wants you to do well. However, she does get annoyed if you are talking to someone while she is. No food or cell phone allowed in class- she will literally call you out. Just be respectful and pay attention. You will receive an easy A!;
Sassiest professor I\'ve ever had. No drinks or food other than water. But, over all her class was pretty easy if you show up, do her daily reflections, and follow her syllabus to the dot. Lot of papers to keep up with. I ended up dividing mine by week in a binder.;
She was a delight! I loved this class so much and she offered so much help. Assignments are easy. Ff you do them right, you will get full credit. She is a tough grader when it comes to tests though, just be sure to study!;
she is good but gives a lot of homework;
Was open about her own opinions so we could start off an honest class discussion as equals. Unlike certain other English professors *ahem-carolynbeardwhitlow-cough*, she embraced different views on the text as long as they were sufficiently supported.;
No Comments;
You either get it or you don\'t- basically the first grade you get it the grade you\'ll always get. I went to tutor after tutor and could not get more than a C+. You can\'t miss any classes for any reason, even one and she\'ll drop your particapation grade;
I took her at NYU. The class was incredibly interesting. The hw assignments were thorough, but really helped you understand the material. She knows what she\'s talking about and really wants the students to learn, and will explain things until everyone gets it. She allowed us to determine exam and essay formats and we made up our own final questions;
Excellent professor.;
Professor Borgwardt is a very good professor who gives engaged, meaningful, and insightful lectures. Personally, I can find her to be a bit verbose and can spend too much time explaining the philosophical concept behind an assignment. However, the quality of her lectures and openness during office hours more than makes up for this.;
This was my first history class in years, but Professor Borgwardt made it really accessible. She was available readily outside of class to answer questions and her lectures were engaging and helpful. She expects a lot from you in terms of readings, but she\'s very clear about her expectations and helps you meet them.;
Dr. Spievak is an outstanding instructor. She is an expert in her field. As long as you put in the work and dedication, she will ensure that you do great. She genuinely cares and your work in her class can without a doubt take you far beyond the class itself. She prepares you for grad school. Do not take, if you aren\'t willing to work for it!!!;
One of the best professors I\'ve ever had! She\'s definitely not easy, but you\'ll learn a lot if you do the work.;
Ive never met anyone who UNDERSTANDS acting the way Elizabeth does. She just KNOWS how to make you better at public speaking, acting-related stuff in particular. I really like her emphasis on differentiating between actor and script. She made me feel welcome among a bunch of hostile theater majors even though I was not as talented/important.;
This woman is the worst teacher ever. she does not care who fails, all she wants to do is make your life miserable cuz she is miserable. i went to class regularily, attempted at her impossible hw, got A\'s on all labs, and did ok on the tests, but i still failed;
Boyd is a very sweet lady and makes learning interesting. I thought dance appreciation was going to be so boring but it\'s not with her.;
Eric is one of my favorite people, let alone favorite professor. His class is one of the only that I participate in. You have lots of reading assignments and they\'re kind of hard to understand, but they\'re very interesting. He gets to know his students and makes everyone feel like what they say is important. I wish I could have him for every class.;
This class can be challenging and the lectures can be kind of hard to sit through but if you do not understand something, Dr. Ruchk and his TA\'s are always willing to answer questions after class and in their office hours. Dr. Ruchk wants to make you think and he teaches in a very different way. With that, you have to go to class to keep up.;
Dr. Winters is a great professor! He will spend a significant amount of time helping you if you need it. He is passionate about his work and puts in a lot of effort to push students to get out of their comfort zones and think about topics in a more abstract manner. If you want to get an A in his class you have to be willing to work hard.;
Cuevas taught me how to write a college paper. He was great with feedback, very funny, and really able to relate to the students. He gives you a chance to revise your worst paper and earn points back. Very fair grader, and really wants his students to do well. Would definitely recommend.;
GREAT!!! I took his class over the summer at Moorpark college and kept up with him just fine. He gives real-life applications of the material throughout his lectures & exams. Has a traditional teaching style & provides book problems for help;
Professor Malitsky was helpful with homework classes during lectures, but her lectures were verbatim from the textbook. So when I attended lectures, I did not need to read from the textbook. I did the minimum work for the class and scored the highest score on the final. The material isn\'t hard, but the teacher is a little boring. But, she is nice.;
This professor was amazing at explaining how to derive the equations she was teaching us. She not only explained why we needed to learn the material but applied it to real life. If you\'ve ever had officer hours with her, you\'ll find she truly wants you to learn the material and will help you in any way she can.;
Professor Fox is a wonderful person and he is very intelligent. He knows what he\'s talking about although sometimes the lecture might be a bit boring because he just talk for an hour and occasionally show us images to demonstrate. But in general, very easy grader and exams are kind of easy too so this is the class to take if you want an easy A.;
She s a good teacher that makes sure her students understand very well. Her explications are clear. highly recommend to do previous midterms and finals which is really helpful.;
About to graduate and Ewa\'s classes remain the most memorable. If you are passionate and interested in the topic she is teaching, you will learn more than you intended to. The one thing that helped me earn an A in every class of hers was CONTACTING HER. She wants to help her students! I had phone meetings with her before every paper. Ewa is amazing;
Two things: heavy reading and group projects. Though all of this in preparation for upcoming tests. Again, the course mainly consists of heavy reading, group projects, tests, and observation projects at the NVC Child Development center. Smyle is very lively and is understanding. She is willing to help if you are confused with any of the readings.;
Because she isn\'t a native English speaker, she can be confusing when she is lecturing;
Take her! She gives a few concept notes and examples on the board. Point out a mistake and she is cool about it. Mostly work on handouts with people you sit with while she walks around and helps. Her teaching style is to let you figure things out while she guides you. Few graded homeworks. She has a Turkish accent, but is very understandable.;
He\'s charming, witty, cultured, and charismatic. I would date him, but this is not a dating site. Do the weekly assignments and study concepts he tells you are going to be part of the essay questions and study guides, and you will do well in his class.;
Professor Catalano is a cool dude. Really enjoyed his class, attendance is mandatory if you want to pass. Tests are rather tough but he offered huge extra credit at the end of the semester. Oh and you need to buy HIS textbook, about 90 bucks. I believe he said he curves final grades if needed;
Awesome Teacher. Take it and go !;
Great teacher, pick him if you actually want to learn something and get an A;
Good professor for this introductory class. The lectures reinforce exactly what\'s in the book so attendance isn\'t really mandatory, but he ends early almost every day. Work through the chapters to answer the weekly true false quizzes and you\'ll be fine.;
I strongly recommend Dr. Giarratani;
Professor Giarratani was an excellent teacher. He really knows a lot about Econ and has a lot of real world experience which he brings into the classroom (he worked with the White House on industrial policy negotiations with the Chinese). He has a great ability to get students to understand concepts and makes the material very clear;
Great presenter and allows students to get involved. One of my favorite classes in my undergrad yet!;
Harvey isn\'t arrogant- he is just extremely intelligent. World Politics is not a light subject and he expects that people are intelligent enough to see both sides of arguments. Loved his class- he was super helpful when I emailed him a question and I believe my exams were marked very fairly (the final was difficult);
The entire class is based on the midterm and the final exam. You don\'t really have to do the readings until you\'re studying, and theres no textbook so thats a bonus. Study hard for the exams and you\'ll do fine. He is incredibly intelligent. Don\'t take this class if you\'re looking for an easy mark!;
He is very easy going. The class is not boring. He helps you to get a good mark.;
Kind of a weird class. I had him for psychology 101 and the lectures were super long at first and not much for the test was covered in class, but towards the end you realize you don\'t have to show up to class except on test days and his stories and life lessons are actually really good and funny. He\'s a good guy. Easy A!;
"Professor Mitchell\'s class was my 1st college course taken in 18 years. His technique annoyed me at first, but once I got the hang of his style, he wasn\'t so bad. Read the book, follow the syllabus, and come to class and you will be fine. His stories are ""quite literally"" legendary!8-)";
Excellent teacher. Very patient, allows corrections on most tests and assignments for credit. He also allows a fair amount of notes to use during quizzes and tests. If you go to class and write notes on everything he writes on the board, you will succeed. He is always willing to take time and help. I got an A in his class.;
Fred is old school, he has corny jokes and uses a pop-up projector but he is an extremely nice teacher. I will admit his lectures are dry, but he is willing to explain and help students (JUST ASK FOR HELP). He lets you make up half points on quizzes and tests. If show up to class you will pass.;
I had not taken algebra for over a decade when I signed up to take college algebra with Mr. Ream. He truly wants students to succeed and as long as you do the assigned homework and reach out to him if you are struggling, he is more than happy to do whatever he can to help. He tries to make math fun and gives curves on the exams - highly recommend;
Mr. Ream goes out of his way to help you understand the material and he provides great feedback. He has a great sense of humor and is never afraid to admit when he\'s wrong. He loves statistics and used real life examples which made learning much easier. I really enjoyed the semester (Spring 2015) and would most certainly take another of his classes;
So... He is the most confusing person I\'ve ever heard speak. However, he can be so helpful if you JUST ASK FOR HELP. I really encourage going to office hours, they help a lot. And he really is a really great guy. You have to learn when to stop paying attention when it stops making sense.;
If you don\'t like Fred or any of his classes then there is clearly something wrong with you. This is the second time I\'ve had him for a class and I have no complaints. Just do the work and you will get an easy A. Make sure you talk to him amount your assignments, ask him about anything so he will know you truly care, and be part of the East Texan.;
I past, but I cant tell you any thing about the class. I can tell you that Williams owns some property and some other personal things about him. Well, I quess the class was about him!!;
Easy teacher, doesn\'t give any homework or any tests. only gave one because he had to he said. doesn\'t even read your answer on the test if its long he says. doesn\'t even pay attention if you show up to class. talks and rambles the whole time. but easy.;
Frampton\'s classes are very old-fashioned, but he still seems to spark my interest. Just read his chapter before class & you will totally get his referenced, witty jokes.;
Classes like this are the reason I came to this school. Brilliant, kind, interested, engaged professor who goes above and beyond to facilitate learning. Often wished lectures wouldn\'t be over so quickly! This class is friendly to science and humanities students, it\'s creative and thought provoking if you go in with the right mind.;
Absolutely my favourite professor, hands down. Funny, passionate, very caring about his students and the subject.;
This prof is honestly one of the best I\'ve ever had.;
he\'s a nice guy, very interesting class, tough but do-able;
"Dr. Sweely is honestly the sweetest professor I have ever had. The class is easy: 2 tests, 2 essays, and an oral report. She doesn\'t allow you to take notes because she says she ""gives the best study guides in the world."" Lectures are short and interesting. You only need the textbook to study for midterm and final. I recommend 100%! Love her.";
Dr. Sweely is my favorite professor so far;
I love Dr. Sweely! She is the best professor I have ever had. I learned so much from her, about art and life too. Take every class you can with her. I left her class with a huge smile on my face every day. She is a shining star!;
I wish Dr. Sweely would teach all of my other courses! She is the brightest ray of sunshine even on the gloomiest day. Essays and exams make up the entire course grade.. so do well so you aren\'t having to bring up your grade all semester. She\'s so wonderful. I plan on taking another one of her courses next semester.;
Professor Sweely is one of my absolute favorite human beings. She is so full of knowledge and you can tell she loves her job. She even makes lectures about thousand year old art interesting. The only down fall of the class is that there are only about 5 grades for the whole year, so you must do well on all of them. Relatively easy A.;
She is the BEST professor and one of the most lovely human beings I have ever met.;
She is the best. She is easy and funny. It s really easy to get an A in this class. There are 2 homework in this class and one project they r easy to do. There r 2 tests and she gives u the study guide for them. I highly recommend her;
Wonderful professor! She loves what she does, and she understands that this class isn\'t essential for your career. All you have to do is write two short, easy papers, a powerpoint presentation, midterm, and final. The midterm/final can be difficult if you\'re not good at memorizing. But east A!;
I took his 5 week accounting 1 class and got an A . Homework assignments are as clear as ever . He uses connect from McGraw hill for the entire class . The homework assignments have video examples that teach you how to solve the problems. Use all ur connect resources and you will pass . Make sure to do extra credit , it really matters.;
"I took the class online Fall 2016. I used to study from Chapter Interactive mostly, sometimes from the huge book or power points. I took notes when watching each chapter interactive. There is some extra credit ""LearnSmart"" of 2 points for each chapter. Also, 10 extra points for taking LACCD survey. 1 weekly homework, and 1 bimonthly exams.";
I took this class online and really enjoyed it. Assignments are laid out from the beginning so you know exactly what you are expected to do and by when. You also are given the opportunity to work ahead to complete assignments before they are due. If you read the material the work is easy as well as the tests. I definitely recommend this course!;
If you can understand conceptual math by reading, then I suggest this course. Otherwise, you should take a lecture course. As long as you read and do the assignments, you can pass. They provide hints and explain how to solve several of the problems. However, if you\'re an accounting major, this probably won\'t help you memorize well.;
Loved taking this class online with this professor! Easy but you have to read to understand the basic concepts.;
Solid choice for Accounting 1, wonderful professor! Highly recommend!;
She\'s sweet and cares deeply for her students. Class focused on art therapy so be prepared to do creative things in an art journal. Doesn\'t grade based on artistic ability (just make sure you meet the criteria explained in syllabus). Takes a while to get papers back, but is a generous grader SINCE prompts are vague;
She was very passionate about her teaching. She always tell you what would be on her tests. Attendance sometimes is required in order to know what is going on in the class surrounding. She is very kind and helpful. Not a lot of homework in her class, though. Easy A.;
Dr. Osland is a fantastic guy and an intelligent professor. Nice as could be and I really enjoyed his lectures (most of them were interactive with the class so that helped to keep things interesting), but he was somewhat weird when it came to grading.. basically on all assignments and tests he took off a couple points and I wasn\'t totally sure why.;
Greta is extremely concerned with her students\'s futures. My writing improved dramatically in her classes. Highly recommended for upper division english.;
This (online) class is extremely easy to get an A in and still manages to be very interesting as the assignments and textbook are well-written and enjoyable. I encourage you to get as much from the course as you can. Dr Guy is very helpful and fast to respond.;
A&P is hard. Prof Mann makes it easier by being very precise with the material. You always know what to expect on tests. Never a surprise. If you study you will do well. If you don\'t you probably won\'t. But Prof Mann is an excellent teacher and does not overwhelm you.;
Great professor. I\'d spend sometimes up to half an hour after class badgering her and she\'d answer and discuss every question whole-heartedly.;
Dr. Khanal knows what he\'s talking about, but he isn\'t always the clearest about expressing that. The assignments can have unclear directions a lot of the time. But for most of the labs, he\'ll walk you through exactly what you need to do.;
I really enjoyed the material taught in this course. Meshaw truly wants his students to do well in the class and gives everything needed to get a good grade. Class attendance is imperative to get all the information covered in the homework and quizzes, but if you show up, you\'ll have everything you need.;
If you strive to do more than just learn the material you will average out. She is a professor who is passionate, and therefore has high expectations. Prepares you for the real world.;
Dr. Albanesi\'s classes are tough but you learn so much. I have taken several both undergrad and graduate level. You must do the reading! Most classes are discussion based. She is incredibly supportive of your learning process. I highly recommend her classes.;
No Comments;
Difficult to understand and told us that she didn\'t want us to use the bathroom during her class! How old we are? If someone has to use the bathroom that is their responibility to both their health and comfort. I never encountered something like that with any other professor in my entire collegiate career. I was shocked.;
Dr. Hon is an amazing human being. She is someone you would want in your life even as a friend! PR Research with her was great. Super helpful, willing to work with you and she was extremely understanding. I wish she taught another course to take her again.;
Ian is a weird guy and not a great instructor but it\'s easy enough to do well if you readmemorize the textbook and show up to class. He loves to hear himself speak so it\'s hard to have meaningful conversations. His marking is inconsistent and ambiguous at times. He doesn\'t really lecture so you have to read and memorize the book to do well.;
Not sure why Ian gets such a bad rep. He is not a super interesting prof but just show up to class and do other class work while you\'re there. You don\'t need to pay attention if you read the textbook instead. 3 non-cumulative midterms and a final project (3 questions answered in essay form).;
AMAZING! Best class I have taken at OCC. Mr. Kinder is helpful and wants to teach you how to protect yourself! I have learned so much, and had to use it once and it saved me from getting hurt. The class is fun and filled which physical activity. Attend class and practice the moves and you will pass. Good Luck!;
Great guy - he\'s very clear and knows what he\'s talking about. The tests were very straight foreward, as were the assignments, and his odd expressions and variety of coloured markers help keep your attention if you\'re starting to drift. Keep on top of the work, otherwise it will seem harder than it is;
8:30AM 3 hour seminar. Quiz every class. 100+ pages of reading/week. Tough marker. That all being said, it was genuinely a privilege to be in Ian Spears 4th year class. It is the most eye opening, provocative and inspirational course at Guelph. He cares about his students and wants them to think critically about every reading. Take this class.;
Best prof I have ever had. Hands down.;
he is a very tough prof, probably the toughest I have ever had but he is by far my favorite. he is a hard marker for essays and has high expectations, but It makes you a better student. He is great to just chat with about issues in class. Overall amazing guy. Totally possible to get 80+ if you hustle all year.;
Hilarious that people complain about the amount of readings in 4340. It\'s a FULL credit course. What did u expect? Gives away 20% of ur mark in weekly quizzes/participation. Much less writing than other full credits(3 essays, 18 pages total). Tough marker for essays, but fair & gives good feedback. Great course, fav prof,interesting, learned a lot.;
"Many call him Ian ""the ratface"" spears";
My favourite prof. Makes lectures interesting. Always there for his students, helpful, & approachable. Wants you to learn & grow. Presents contrasting arguments to really make you think. No textbook. Content can be challenging so you have to make effort. I like that he encourages class discussion but sometimes he lets people drone on for too long.;
One of my favourite professors at Guelph. He truly makes lectures enjoyable to attend. I believe he is an extremely fair marker and creates good exams, but his classes are not easy.;
Spears is one of those profs that has an almost legendary reputation among students. He\'s incredibly engaging, friendly, intelligent, and helpful. His classes are not easy. The readings are fairly long, but interesting. He expects high-quality essays, and his examinations require thorough knowledge of all the readings. And yet you\'ll still love it.;
Dr. Andrews is a great professor, I loved his class! He gives many extra credit opportunities, you just need to read all of the texts to pass.;
Great Professor. Had him for 207 and again for 455. Great in the big lectures, but try and take a smaller class with him if you can. He\'s the only professor at Eastern who even bothered to learn my name. Really wants to hear what you have to say. Challenging, but not unfairly so. Highly recommended.;
He is a solid professor, and has his teaching assistants do most of his work for him. You\'re graded on a couple quizzes, tests, and papers. It\'s lecture heavy, but the slides that go with it are pretty informational so if you miss a class or two it won\'t kill your grade. We read a lot, but they also go in depth about the books.;
He\'s alright. His lectures are long, and unclear because he tells us to write down random adjectives. I didn\'t read one of the books, and still passed with an A though. Mid term and final exam, 1 research paper, and weekly quizzes. Lecture slides are online.;
Love love loved this class. Being a lecture, attendance is not technically mandatory, but I always went. It was enjoyable. Keep ahead on the readings and you will do fine. Dr. Andrews is an awesome professor. Extra credit opportunities.;
Loved this professor, easy and right to the point. If you needed anything he was always there.;
The things that I could say about this woman. I could go on for days. Probably a great nurse in the field, but absolutely neurotic in class. Reads straight from slides;
You can tell that she definitely knows what she is talking about, but lecture is ridiculously long and boring. She goes off on random tangents and many lectures she only goes over 10 or 11 slides because she is so long winded. Tests are hard, but they prepare you for NCLEX. I thought the paper was the toughest as she is an APA format freak.;
Professor Olaye gives several projects throughout the semester. They are all public speaking presentations about different topics. All require an outline and PPT. Tests aren\'t too difficult. They\'re based off the textbook, which is super easy to read and understand. Put in the effort, listen to feedback, study, and you\'re all set. Great professor!;
His exams are incredibly specific and unless you start studying 2 weeks before the exam, do not expect higher than a 70 on any of his tests. I rewrote the entire textbook and went to the learning center to review for his class. I ended up getting an A but I worked for it. He knows his exams are hard though so he\'s a bit more lenient with the gradin;
She is very straight and to the point. It is helpful to highlight in the book during lecture, most of what she says and puts on the test comes straight from the it. Highlighting makes it a lot easier to study for her tests, use that as your study guide. She does not take attendance, but her lectures are definetly helpful for the tests.;
ics 139w was one of the few classes i really enjoyed going to. very pragmatic in what he taught, but in a good way. i highly recommend him for this course.;
He makesaid class time highly amusing, and he is very knowledgeable in the subject area.;
Content is well-explained;
Dr. Chambers is an awesome professor. Dr. Chambers just made it easier to learn biochem but you still have to study alot. anyone who complains about him was just being lazy and wanted an easy A. I just took a practice MCAT and scored 515 with no studying or practice because he makes you learn and understand not just memorize.;
Dr. Chambers is very knowledgeable, passionate, and funny. I took this course in fall because the other easy professors were taken, and I am glad I did. I been studing for the MCAT and this class made the bio-chemical section a breeze! It was hard, for sure, but worth it. Make sure you show up to every class.;
Go ahead and ignore any review that\'s before 2016 as he\'s changed his style. 1st 2 tests don\'t matter grade wise. STUDY THE POWERPOINTS, supplement with the book if needed, do the hw, GO TO CLASS, ask questions so he knows who you are, and the A is yours. If you UNDERSTAND THE PATHWAYS, then the final is easy. His tests were easier than Renthal\'s.;
HE IS ONE THE BEST PROFS I HAVE EVER HAD!;
HE IS ONE THE BEST PROFS I HAVE EVER HAD! HE WAS ALWAYS THERE FOR HIS STUDENTS. BRINGS PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR SHELL.;
Dr. Tompkins teaches for understanding, not memorization. Come to class, participate and pay attention. Hi lecture videos are exactly what he taught in class so if you don\'t understand something, watch it until you get it. His quizzes are short, but difficult. I cannot stress enough how important coming to class and paying attention are.;
He is just a great Professor and do not hesitate to take his course. explains things well.;
Glad she\'s hot-wish she could teach!;
This is a hard class. I don\'t know that I could\'ve done as well with a different type of instructor. Dr. Mills\' lectures are clear and easy to understand, she gives you tons of practice problems that are similar to the graded quizzes and assignments. Don\'t get overwhelmed, take it week by week. Watch the lectures and do the work. Proud of my A!;
He\'s got a heavy accent that you can get used to if you try hard enough. He\'s very nice, but not very clear. i thought i was gonna fail the class but I ended up with a C. I wouldn\'t go out of my way to take this class but I also wouldn\'t be scared away from the bad reviews. Its very passable.;
I found Professor Wager very helpful. She does have a specific way she wants you to write, but does make it clear after the first few assignments. She helped me with brevity, but wanted me to change my writing style to match the way she liked it. She was a decent professor, and is very willing to help.;
I LOVE Prof. Wager. She\'s hilarious and dedicated. I took this as the hybrid block and I loved it. It is fast paced, but not a ton of work. The final is only a 5 page paper, and you can revise your essays as many times as you want. She really wants you to do well and helps you as much as you can. If I could take every class with her, I would.;
Jans does an excellent job of teaching the basics and technical aspects of cinema while putting a feminist/progressive spin on things. Great professor who cares that her class learn new perspectives from her lectures. She is a solid grader and gave great feedback whenever I asked for it. My writing skills have improved from taking this course!;
Really enjoyed her class. Took it as a hybrid block class so it was very fast paced and all the assignments were submitted online. She was very clear about how she wanted you to write and was very willing to help. I would take her again, I was very impressed with her teaching style.;
Taken as Hybrid course. It was good taking it with this teacher. Especially in a hybrid course she only assigns stuff that is needed. Be aware if you take this in a hybrid class there will be something due EVERY time before the next class. Course work is easy if you are committed to it and turn it in on time. PEER reviews are not accepted late.;
Wager is a great professor! She makes the class lively and is absolutely hilarious. I took the hybrid-block course. As long as you do the assignments on time it\'s an easy A. The only complaints I have are: a lot of the examples/ content is politically influenced (liberal) and she doesn\'t always describe assignments or what is expected of you well.;
I took Jason\'s EmAC class years ago. Jason maintains that perfect balance of friend and professor. He knows how to earn respect from his students as well as give respect to his students. I learned a ton from Jason and his class really broadened my horizons as an artist and did so in a very encouraging way. Jason is an absolute asset to MICA imo.;
good teacher;
He basically gives the type of questions that are asked on the exams and final. He mainly just takes questions from hw and lecture notes and just changes them a bit. So if you understand the concept your fine. It is important that you come to his classes on time.;
His lectures are pretty straight forward and easy to follow. He likes to give out exam related problems during the lecture, so it\'s best to show up. He grades a bit harder than most, but you will do fine if you do the recommended problems and show up to class.;
Jay is a great teacher and is very clear in his description of Calculus II concepts. He is extremely funny and always engaging during class. He\'s the perfect balance of a teacher who actually does an effective job of explaining material and making class enjoyable.;
Dr. Kurtz is a transformational educator. Very rarely do students have an opportunity to learn from a teacher such as him. He does not parent you, but he expects a mature student to be prepared and engaged each day. He is wicked smart. He is hilarious, in his own awkward, offbeat way. He cares a lot about what he does and it shows. Simply great;
If he is still teaching his \'Rhetoric of the Civil Rights Movement\' please take it. One of the best classes Denison has to offer.;
Dr. Lynn is a very engaging speaker but sometimes he is not always appropriate. During a lecture on ethics he made us pull out our phones and show him our Facebook pages. He said he wanted to check them for ho pictures. It is not his business what we do on our personal time. This was during a lecture on ethics.;
I took this class online and passed with a B. You do have to put in the work but the professor is the best. Just make sure you keep up with your weekly assignments and quizzes. He provides study guides for both mid-term and final. You need only to buy the code for the book.;
This class is not easy. So much work in ConnectMath, it\'s insane! But! Professor Gutliph is great! He knows you have lots of work to do, and he tries to help you and make it easier on you as much as he can. For example, his discussions are easy, and he gives a great review for your Midterm and Final exam! Definitely recommend!;
Dr. Kent is awesome. His lecture and labs are the most difficult I\'ve ever had but also the best. I graduated the RAD program 2 years ago and his classes helped a ton in the long run. My advice? Worry less about the textbook and a lot more about what he SAYS and writes on the board. If you can\'t listen/recall what he wrote on the board you\'ll fail.;
Dr. Kent is my favorite teacher. He is very thorough and tells you everything you need to know. Studying is a MUST for this class! Especially for the essay questions, but he gives study guides that literally has EVERYTHING on it you will need. So helpful, always made time if I didn\'t understand something. Also gives amazing extra credit.;
Dr. Kent is very smart and he makes that very obvious. His tests consists of a lot of critical thinking but he certainly gives you the tools to succeed. He has weekly review sessions to go over essay questions and even gives extra credit for attending them! I would take him again! Do or do not, there is no try! you have to put forth the effort.;
Dr. Kent\'s class is tough, but his willingness to help makes a good grade possible. However, because he is so passionate about what he teaches, he is extremely thorough. As long as you don\'t mind putting in the hard work, Kent is a great teacher. He truly cares about the success of his students. I had him for A&P1 L and taking him again for A&P 2.;
Hardestsmartest professor I\'ve ever met in my life. He was even the co-author of our textbook that many colleges use, lol. I only earned an A in his class because of his incredible teaching ability. He will fill the entire board up multiple times per lecture but you better write every word of it down. He never gets off topic and always helps you.;
Professor Kent is extremely smart and makes it clear he wants his students to succeed and understand the material he is teaching. He gives you all the tools you need in order to pass his test. He gives you so much material and lets you know exactly what is on the exam. I would take him again!;
Awesome Professor. I loved his approach to teaching. We did have a surprise group project which was not on the syllabus but I liked that he graded on individual contributions because some people were just terrible. He was great wit answering questions and clarifying topics and he participated in the forums along with the students. I\'d take him.;
No Comments;
I got an A in the class, but i hated going to class. I dreaded it. When we were in class we didn\'t even talk about history majority of the time. You have to read four chapter books and do a book review. Those are your tests. If you don\'t read, you won\'t pass. The quiz\'s were a pain. She gives so much info, that it is hard to get ready for a quiz.;
Very real professor who gives no BS. She tells you the way it is and what the history really was like. She gives her opinion (which tend to be very strong), but hears other peoples opinions and respects them. Learned so many great things from this class and professor;
Good introductory course for CJ majors. She has a lot of experience with undergraduate students.;
Dr. Spock is one smart lady. Not many people know as much about history as she does, especially when it comes to the Mongols and Russia. If you are a history minor or major you will benefit greatly from her class, however;
Dr. Spock was very good at giving lectures, but the course load is insane. I\'m talking three or four assignments due every week. This was a general education course for me, but this was the class I spent the majority of my time studying and doing homework for. It is a very difficult class and you will not pass without effort. I would NOT recommend;
I loved Dr. Spock! Her class is probably one of the harder ones that I\'m currently taking, but she gives LOTS of extra credit and is always ready to help. You will do more writing than you might like, but she gives good feedback. Lots of reading, lots of class participation. It\'s a tough class for a gen ed, but I would definitely take her again;
he is really easy if u want to really understand and know things from his class i advice you to take another person. he is an easy A all you have to do is come take attendance and leave if u want,but he just makes you work on the test questions. witch are on line. if u need a humanities class take him he is easy.;
If you want an A - take this class! He is extremely knowledgeable in his field, but not real computer saavy. Copy the questionsanswers to all PowerPoints down as you will need those for the online tests for each chapter. Classmates are loud and rude to him and take advantage of his kind nature. No final-just show up to get your final grade.;
My only complaint with Dr. Scripps\' web applications course was that his material was somewhat dated. Direct questions about HTML5 or new JavaScript standards fell by the wayside. That being said, Scripps has an interest in data science, so his thoughts and answers on the internet and web technologies as a whole are very insightful.;
This was the most boring lecture and I eventually stopped attending. If you show up for the lab portion and do the online homework on your own, you should get an easy A. This was a very easy class but required a lot of time doing online work. I think Jerry was a very smart prof, but he had a hard time dumbing it down to our level.;
She might seem intimating, but that\'s only because she cares about her students. She is very knowledgeable about the subject and answers any questions you ask her. Her lectures are long, but always interesting. You\'ll pass the class as long as you do your reading, take notes and do the projects.;
Dr. Burns has been in the Rawls since the building was erected. His class can be dry at times, but you learn what you need to for your future careers. He had a TA that graded our project grammar and we got a lot of points taken off (He averages the substance and grammar grades together). All in all, very difficult. Work hard and you will do fine.;
He\'s a good lecturer. At no time to you look at the slides on your own and feel completely lost. You have a long time to do the homework. Just do four or five questions a day. He will get into a conservative digression every now and then, but it isn\'t overbearing. Neither is his humor. Great class to be given a bone scorewise while also learning.;
The late professor Curtis has interesting lectures, but the DE course is on cruise-control now. There\'s almost no interaction, feedback, or help. Test/exam questions are based almost entirely on the text. Print out your tests because half the questions reappear on the final exam.;
Very clear and great in lecture. He grades his tests tough but if you know the notes and do all of the practice problems they aren\'t that bad.;
Great guy, horrible professor. He would be a great professor for students not taking an intro course. He is very unclear in his expectations and has major mood swings. Kicked whole class out twice for things we have no control over. Probably the reason the theatre department is not strong at UA. Would take as a sr but maybe not as a fresh or soph;
Best instructor I have had in my four years at IU - very knowledgeable and clear communicator;
Terrific teacher in every facet. He has perfected the teaching of E321.;
I don\'t know why people are so bitter towards this prof, she\'s actually great. Gave out 3% in free bonus marks to basically everyone. The midterm on the syllabus said chapters 1-7, she made it easier by only covering chapters 2,3,4, and 7. I studied total 12 hrs for midterm and got an A. Content on tests were directly from textbook and lectures.;
lazy prof, not helpful to tend to students\' questions. Not consistent with what she said would be covered on midterm/exam.;
She\'s a very nice lady, but this class is extremely boring. She makes you do five papers throughout the semester on the in-class exercises, which aren\'t hard to do. She\'s a very fair and easy grader. There are four quizzes as a means of evaluation - no tests, which is nice. The class wasn\'t hard, but I\'d take another class for the GS credit.;
Eisberg is AMAZING. Very enthusiastic and easy going professor and is always available to help. She tends to ramble though, she\'ll spend 20 minutes answering a yes or no question but I\'d take her again. As long as you go to class and do the homework and online quizzes you\'ll pass and there\'s a few extra credit opportunities.;
Eisberg is awesome. Hardest class I\'ve taken but so incredibly worth it. She is passionate about what she teaches. She is there for assistance if you need it. She wants to help the students. I loved the content. I would totally recommend her!;
Professor Eisberg is a great professor. She\'s super enthusiastic about astronomy and very helpful. There is homework pretty much every week, you should be prepared to dedicate a few hours to that (basically twice the length of the online lecture). Lots of assignments, but they\'re easy and are all completed in class.;
He is a nice man but his lectures are long and confusing. You have to read the textbook otherwise you won\'t really know what is happening. Make sure to study really hard. He doesn\'t really like for you to ask questions, but as long as you study and try to pay attention you should be fine.;
I\'ve taken both Dr. Baers\' Education Psychology and online creativity courses. Education Psychology is fairly hard, but the online creativity course was easy, very light homework and no tests. He\'s a nice man who cares about his students and what he\'s teaching. Talks a little fast sometimes.;
Loved Professor Baer, lectures were a little boring but always tried to make it interesting and hands-on by including small group-work. Gives lot of hand outs, and you do not need to read all of them. Tests are difficult, use Quizlet and books to your advantage. I would definitely take him again!;
Amazing class. Entertaining and knowledgeable, plus he\'s more than willing to accommodate changes in schedule. Show up and you\'ll have to try to fail;
Dr. Baker is a nice person. I did not like this class however due to being graded by few things. Some of which these things were out of the student\'s control. For instance, the egg drop or glider project either worked or it didn\'t work and your grade depended on it. We didn\'t know our egg was going to break and our grade suffered. No tests.;
Great guy, great class. Incredibly nice and willing to work with students. Show up for 121 and you\'re practically guaranteed to pass;
Hands down one of the best professors I have ever had. Has a true passion for teaching and explains everything very well so that anybody could understand the material. Very willing to help you with anything/ class even if he does not teach it. I wish all professors could teach as well as him.;
seriously in love with this man..he is so helpful and caring. best professor I\'ve ever had. I highly recommend him.;
Mr. Charlesworth is the BEST. He is hilarious and knows so much about space. If you\'ve been daydreaming about the unknown, take his class! It\'s an easy A if you show up and do the work! You have to study for the final or you may not pass. He is available outside of class to help you if you\'re struggling as well.;
Very interesting and enjoyable class and teacher. He does everything he can to be helpful, but you have to attend and study every week! Highly recommended for serious students.;
Invokes discussion, and provides useful feedback. My only issue is the amount of reading, and the exams require you to remember specific points from all readings. TA\'s do the grading so be sure to ask them what they look for! Not the easiest course, but Corvino\'s lectures are sure to get you thinking about things from a new perspective. Smart guy.;
Professor Corvino is fantastic! He is funny and caring. This class consisted of a lot of reading and only 4 exams so come to every class and study hard for the exams!;
His enthusiasm was contagious, and I even appreciated his quirks. I still display those brass and copper mobiles in my living room. Judging from the other ratings, I was very lucky to get on his good side.;
Animated, intelligent, humorous, clear expectations, takes notes, read, prepare for exams and make a good grade. Do not expect to pass without being diligent. The best professor I have ever taken , including graduate school;
Buy the book from the bookstore! Do not buy the online code without the book. The book is a must. Easy Class. Gives Extra credit. Basics for Excel, Word, Access, and Power Point. Only gave 3 exams throughout the semester. Sometimes/a lot of times forgets stuff class had to remind him. Overall an easy class. I would recommend him. Nice teacher.;
Eaaaasssyyyyyyy!!! But talks very fast, gets kind of mad when you ask questions cause you are confused. Anyways would recommend if you need credit/units. Easy A.;
He started the class 3 days after the short semester started. He\'s very unclear with instructions and doesn\'t respond to emails. He\'s not involved with the class and the program is what will be teaching you and grading your work. The program is extremely specific in how it wants you to answer homework/exams questions which is extremely frustrating.;
This class was too easy. I seriously could have done it in my sleep. If you know the basics of power point, word, excel, and access you will get an A. Just show up, participate and turn in your assignments on time. This class could be hard for anyone with very limited computer skills, but for most it will be the easiest class of their academic path;
Best professor I\'ve ever had! I normally dread math class and do poorly in the class but this was the one exception. As long as you attend class, take notes, and make sure you do your homework this class will be fairly easy. Mr. Moliassa is an excellent professor, he\'s funny and easy to listen to and is always available to help!;
This professor is AWESOME! If you show him that you care, he will help you raise your grade! Make sure to do your homework and and go to his office before you submit a quiz and after you submit in exam, this will guarantee you to get a higher grade! you willl NOT regret taking this course with him, he\'s the best!;
Class was an easy A for me. I went 3 times (test days) and got an A. Tests are written essays and I always crammed 3 days before (It worked for me). Here\'s how you get an A... GO TO SI AND TA SESSIONS, email TA\'s about outline and thesis, study with flashcards, write 10-15 pages for essay (It sounds scary but it\'s easy to do), 10/10 would recommend;
John is an amazing lecturer, his tangents are hilarious and usually relate back to the point. This class was actually super interesting;
Professor Reed has clear, well constructed lectures that specifically prepare you for the exams. This is NOT a memorize and pass class. You need to be able to digest the information and explain diverse factors to support a thesis statement for the exams. The assigned reading is essential. TAKE notes, his lectures are very helpful.;
"Professor Reed is a great professor, but if you are a conservative, he may offend you in many ways. He speaks greatly about ""Bernieites"" but as soon as he brings up President Trump, it\'s nothing but garbage. Besides his harsh opinion in lecture, the material he gives you helps you with the exams. SI sessions are a must if you want a good grade.";
Professor Reed, and his lectures, are very monotone, dry and boring. I only went to class twice outside of the tests (which are essays) and still received an A. Going to class and buying the book are not necessary at all. But going to the TA sessions the days before the tests are CRUCIAL to passing. They go over exactly what you should write.;
No Comments;
Awesome director of Chamber Winds!!;
I loved evolution with Bro. Zenger. The subject matter itself is pretty easy. Just read from the text book, and discuss in class. There is a very large paper you have to write, which is a lot of work, but you get to choose what you write about, so that helps. Bro. Zenger is a great teacher and he cares deeply about his students.;
Do not take! If you must: play nice, learn 2 names, dates, important events, and basic bio of assigned person. Ignore all assigned reading: exam Q\'s given one week in advance, plenty to time to prep if you are strong student. Do not skip class but you will want to! Pop quiz, term paper, exams: respond to each sentence of question, be specific!;
Dr. Fisher is super chill guy and his lectures are easy to pay attention. However, his tests are super detail oriented and have lots of small things. All in all though, I would definitely take his class again.;
Dr. Fisher was a great professor. I liked his lectures, he tried to keep it interesting, and sometimes he\'ll share a scrap of his personal life. He tries to answer any questions during a lecture. I never used office hours, but I knew they were available. His tests aren\'t bad compared to other bio professors. Bio is just a hard course overall.;
Dr. Fisher was awesome, he says the funniest corny jokes during class. He keeps his lectures interesting. Records all lectures on tegrity, but you have to come to class in order to get the clicker points. Tests were not difficult for me but were difficult for classmates. Class averages on exams were usually in the low 70s. Final exam was easy;
He speaks very monotone and does not keep students engaged by any means. Thus, it is very hard to stay awake and the way he presents material makes it difficult to remember. This makes the exams incredibly difficult. The exams are also random and unrelated to in-class information. Fisher is also very wishy-washy when it comes to class policies.;
Not too shabby, enjoyed him;
You can tell he is passionate about teaching and his lectures are highly educational. He throws in funny remarks during his lectures to keep class interesting. Use his homework as a way to keep track of what to study. He also gives out old tests with answer keys before each exam.;
"I\'ve read a lot of reviews about how Dr. Caspi is ""emotionless"" but he does try to notice and get to know your personality but you have to be open! I\'d have my off days and he\'d always notice and he genuinely cared. In regards to the class, he likes messing with your head but its a good learning tool for this specific class. I found it interesting.";
An amazing professor. Unfortunately I did not take his Theater Arts 7A class, but 7B was an amazing class. As we all know professor Sierra said that he is not going to teach anymore, however it was great pleasure to be in his class. Hated when some mentally challenged students used their phones for texting, was crystal clear and very funny)))));
He gives a lecture every class, and you watch a movie after that. You need to attend class (even if you have seen the movie) in order to take notes (he tells you what you need to know for the exams). 2 exams, and one research project. Easy class, he is sarcastic and funny. You need to read the book.;
I had this professor years ago for English 49B and one of the theater arts film classes. He was the best! His film noir class was so much fun, and I still remember it fondly almost ten years later because now I\'m a huge TCM classic film fan. His classes were easy As and he allowed us to do revisions on papers.;
I\'ve taken three film classes with Sierra because not only is he awesomely cynical but you have to be a complete idiot to get anything lower than an A. He makes all of his papers and quiz material extremely clear to follow. This class is even enjoyable for non-film majors.;
Midterm, Final, & Paper. Paper is extremely easy, emphasize the extremely. Midterm & final are both open notebook & book. Come to class & write down EVERYTHING he says. Highlightunderline the ones that he says will be on the test. Print out the class lecture notes instead of copying it from the screen. Stay for the movies, q\'s will be on tests!;
One of the coolest professor. He always make jokes and share personal experience to entertain and at the same time he has a extremely detailed note coverage makes along with online proof reading. Tests are 100% from the notes/book/online reading. If you have all 3 of these prepared, this class would be extremely entertaining and easy.;
Prof. Sierra is an interesting man;
Not fully comprehend half of the time what she is saying. If you have not taken Spanish before or during high school, do not take her. She did not explain the materials really well. Her tests are easy if you know Spanish. 4 tests, drops 1.;
I learned so much from taking this class and I really enjoyed it! She gives ppt lectures and provides links to articles and videos to help with the lecture. She truly cares about her students\' success. Just do the reading, take notes, keep up with the discussions, and wou will do well in the tests.;
Kaci is a great teacher. True, you dont have the time to complete projects out of class (all are done in class), but she helps you and has no problems getting back to you with any questions.;
Dr. Carr is one of those English teachers that you either love or you hate. You will read a whole awful lot, but the books are generally interesting. Classes are just one big discussion, where basically no topic is off-limits. As long as you can read and just talk a lot during class, you\'ll get a good grade.;
I took her online social psych class, and the class is just reading the book and doing homework out of it. There\'s about 3 or 4 chapters w/ approx. 4 assignments eahc due in a month. It can be a lot, but just pace yourself and do things early and you can get everything done. However the stuff that you read is really interesting and eye opening.;
I took the online spring course and it was easy. Yes, you will have to read the whole book, but it\'s interesting information. The test and quizzes were simple and easy if you read the chapters. She answered all my questions in a timely manner. She uses a point system instead of grades, which I actually liked. I would take her again.;
Prof was rude and condescending. Asked for help on multiple occasions and felt like she was annoyed that I had any questions in an online course. She did not communicate effectively and gave short notice of deadline changes. Overall the class was neither challenging nor helpful and was generally unpleasant. Would not recommend.;
Prof. Kaplowitz is an amazing professor, she makes you read a lot though. If you don\'t like to read don\'t bother taking her class. Quizzes are done either before every class or every other class. I hated reading, God knows I still do but she makes you read interesting novels that will have you wanting to know what\'s next. Do the work, guaranteed A.;
If I wanted to be talk to like a kid id go to a day care. this woman talk to her students like we are 6 years old.;
This prof talks to you like you are a child of 7, not an adult of 19 -20. It\'s a joke. Haven\'t been in something so juvenile since 2nd grade. Insulting. Didn\'t learn a thing from her. Good thing students do her job for her. She doesn\'t seem to respect students enough to talk to them as adults. I don\'t pay thousands to be treated like I\'m 7. Avoid.;
Very invested in her students. Will do anything to help them succeed!;
The best professor you will ever meet. It has been an absolute pleasure.;
Dr. Greene is an excellent professor! She is very opiniated, but she can defend every single one of her views with facts, statistics, etc. Also, if you have a different view, she will let you share with the class because she encourages debate. She will not treat you any differently if you have a different opinion. Do your readings and you will pass;
Dr. Greene is probably the most awesome teacher I\'ve had my whole life. She is unapologetic about her views and she has no problem telling you why she feels the way she does with facts, stats, and history. Here in MS, it\'s such a refresher to see someone push back with the norm here and really make their students think. So thankful for her !!;
Kate doesn\'t care what anyone thinks and it\'s awesome. She a feminist and Buddhist with very strong political opinions she won\'t see for herself. Class discussions are always fun, If you have a problem with other people\'s opinions don\'t take her classes.;
Not much homework, all test are written response, but she give awesome test reviews. If you come to class you will pass.;
This was such a great class. I learned a lot and it was really easy to pass as long as you showed up and you did the work. She doesn\'t ask a lot of students. There is a 15-20 page paper so beware of that if you decide to take her class.;
She is way too kind hearted and gets taken advantage of. Most people don\'t sleep in her class because they don\'t come in the first place. Those that do get to see some decent movies. Overall I liked her even though many thought she was unclear at times.;
Best professor by far. She is one of the few that truly cares about the well-being of her students. As a result, she devotes considerable time and effort into improving her students and preparing them for life after graduation. Many students mirror these sentiments, but some do not truly realize how much she has helped them until later down the ro;
"Dr. Mcfadden is an excellent professor. She goes out of her way to ensure students learn the material. The cases in this class helps with real world application. There is a team research paper that further enhances your learning. There are 2 tests and one non-cumulative final. An ""A"" is attainable but you must work for it. Overall A+ Professor";
Dr. Ochshorn is such a sweet lady. The class is based around 4 essays which are easy as long as you put in a little effort, then there are readings due every class with pop quizzes that are easy if you read (drops lowest quiz grade). Lectures can be a bit boring but, she always lets you out of class early. Sweet lady would recommend;
Had to read up to 40-60 pages of boring travel pieces between EVERY class and only had 4 writing assignments. No one in the class did all of the reading cause it was a ridiculous amount. Everyone did poorly on quizzes. Barely got any feedback on our few assignments. Horribly boring class, not helpful at all, still got an A. Good luck with her...;
One of my hardest classes yet. She grades tough, but is pretty fair. Make sure you go to class for the in class problems, as well as doing the take home problems. She knows a lot about her field. She ended up curving our overall grade even though she does not curve tests.;
She is one of the best professors I\'ve had at WMU. She really knows her lectures and is extremely knowledgeable of her subject. She is helpful and very respectful. Her tests are difficult so you will need to study a lot. You can buy the book for practice problems, but not mandatory. I got an A and never bought the book.;
ANTH of Outer Space is possibly the best class I\'ve had. Denning is an absolute delight! She is extremely quick-witted and can talk at length without putting everyone to sleep. Granted, I was very keenly interested in the content to start with. She\'s thought-provoking and funny. Her teaching style is casual but effective.;
I took Kathy\'s photography class in 2000/2001. She was excellent at motivating individuals with photographic art. I wasn\'t the best photographer but I did enjoy the projects and they surprisingly came out well. I always admired my classmates and their creativity with her projects. She was excellent - Thanks Kathy;
Kathy is a very laid-back type of professor. Attendance is usually not mandatory as long as you do put in the work. She does have very unorthodox approaches to assignments and projects and the medium in which she bestows it on her students. However, there is method to her madness, and I do feel like I retain info from her classes.;
Great teacher! If you pay attention and come to class you will do fine! She\'s very understanding and always there to help! She will reward those who try and comes to class. Would defiantly take again!;
I lover Professor Moore!! Prior to enrolling in Math 80, I had no idea how to do a lot of things, and my pre-cal class I took in HS made my confidence lower about my math skills. She\'s very enthusiastic and not boring at all. I learned sooo much and she gives out a lot of extra credit! I definitely recommend her if you are not lazy!!!!;
Kathy is well aware most people dislike math and as a result makes great efforts to make this class as painless as possible. No textbook purchases are required too which is a huge bonus. Highly recommended.;
Mrs Moore is so helpful that at almost every opportunity there is a chance for extra credit, shes helpful and like in any class, DO THE HOMEWORK!! thats the only way to pass. she makes time available to help via office hours and through email and she has an SI leader help the class. Definitely gave me an opportunity to be happy with math again!;
Favorite instructor in the ECE department. She\'s professional, but alao so caring and helpful. She genuinely cares about her students. She gives so much amazing that is so helpful if you really go over it. Always has time for students if they want to talk about a grade. Brings in personal experiences to compliment a lecture/lesson. Great teacher!!!;
Awful. Not helpful and quite condescending. Might want to examine where her paychecks come from - her students.;
This teacher offers colleagues and classmates to take time to discuss their literary preferences and campus activity. gREAT writ and teacher. I recommend.;
Professor Williams give fair tests but requires a lot out of his students. Computer assignments (mandatory grade of C+ or higher to pass) take very long to complete (10+ hours) and are only worth 10% of the final grade. Lectures can often be off topic and hard to follow as he moves fast. With preparation and studying this class can be an A however.;
Dr. Carmean is a great professor and I\'m excited to take another class with her! 1 worksheet on a 50-or-so minute film and a quiz over the book every week. No actual textbook, but you do have to read two books. Show up to class! Take it seriously! You will be better off for it!;
She is an amazing professor. She is passionate about her field. She loves her students. She is always available to talk in her office.;
Generic intro course lectures. I found them interesting and useful for classes I have taken since then.;
She didn\'t let the class use technology to take notes, but it didn\'t matter as she provided the power point slides on ICON, all I had to do was print them off. I recommend taking notes directly on the power point slides she provides for the class. Exams are over lectures and the textbook. She explains everything in detail. A lot of extra credit!;
Best class ever, I just took this class to fill some of G.E credit but it was more than what I expected. You have to take notes or printed them out, you also have online quizzes and hw (easy), and some problems sets. The tests are multiple choice and also short answer questions. I really recommend this class.;
The online class was very disorganized, which made the class very hard. I had to email him a lot with questions and clarifications because of this. He\'s usually pretty good about answering emails and is very willing to help you understand and do well. Class is based around reading lectures, exams, paper- actually do the work and you\'ll be fine.;
He\'s an awesome professor! If you pay attention and copy all his class notes, you can easily get an A in his class. We had a quiz every Friday (about 3-5 questions) and 4 tests in total. He does assign homework, but it\'s just so you can get extra practice and he doesn\'t even grade it. I will definitely take him again!;
Prof. Yager is overall a good teacher. He can be slightly intimidating (esp. when in a small class), but he tries hard to make connections with his students. There is homework every night, but it is never too lengthy or difficult;
Yager is the absolute best professor I\'ve had on campus. He\'s super helpful, and you will learn a lot. Overall his class is easy, but his exams are brutal. Study hard.;
I agree...he\'s nice but I\'m constantly lost.;
After I read these reviews I didn\'t want to like this class. But one smile at me the first day and he got me. Yeah, he knows he\'s a campus Rock Star. But it only adds to his charm. The man just loves his job. Never in a bad mood. Passionate and brilliant. Every class is a show. And you\'ll learn alot. Sit in front for the best view. :);
Dr. Rahimzadeh is brilliant and he knows it. Which can be very annoying. He\'s been everywhere, he\'s read everything, and he thinks he\'s right about everything. But he\'s also the nicest, most supportive, funniest professor I\'ve had at Eastern. And yes he\'s nice to look at. If you don\'t take his class you are missing out on a key EKU experience.;
He\'s a Silver Fox with a side of Awesome Sauce! He has a gazillion lines of Shakespeare memorized so every class starts with a performance, sometimes with props and costumes. Really cool and really fun. And you\'ll learn tons. Just don\'t let him catch you staring at his eyes or his hair or his everything. You\'ll blush and it will be awkward.;
if you don\'t take this professor during your time at EKU, you will never forgive yourself. If every professor were like him, id never want to graduate. He is absolutely incredible. He cares about the students, he is insanely smart and outgoing, and wants to see you succeed. Please, if you get the chance, take class with him. you won\'t regret it;
If you have the chance to take him, DO IT! He will make you work for your grade, but if you put in the effort, he is willing to give you as much help as you need. He seriously is amazing!!;
This was probably one of the most amazing classes I have ever experienced in college. Dr. Rahimzadeh managed to make the most boring, horrible ancient stories some of the most interesting things to learn about. If you read the text and come to class there is no reason you shouldn\'t get an A. He\'s seriously brilliant and he will change your life.;
Totally adorable. He\'s this weird combination of super shy and super aggressive at the same time. Everything you want from a professor, crazy smart and always entertaining. Listen to lectures carefully because every sentence he says is hilarious. Every single one. And like he says, do the reading, come to class, take notes, go home with the A.;
Very easy class. Gives lots of reviews and even let us use open note for every quiz/test. Basically just show up, take notes, and talk once in a while and you\'ll do great.;
Fun and interesting class, great for beginners.;
She is a wonderful instructor for yoga. I enjoyed the class and she worked with me on doing other positions if I could not do what others could because of an injury/surgery. She is very mindful of that.;
"She\'s horrible. She talks as if she\'s unsure of what she\'s about to say. She tells you, ""TRUST ME...I WILL LEAD YOU THERE."" She takes a VERY long time to get to her point. Her labs do not relate to what you\'re learning from the textbook. Class isn\'t mandatory, but she WILL yell at you and say you\'re a bad role model if you don\'t go. AVOID HER!!!!!!";
A great prof and person overall. Tests are always reasonable and to the point. Lectures were always interesting and he even uploads the audio of his lectures which is a GREAT help to auditory listeners!!;
i was nervous because many reviews i read said the course gets difficult. i didn\'t find that it was difficult at all, and i\'m not really a student that keeps up with work. i never even opened my textbook and i always left class 15-30 minutes early for my next one across campus. you can tell he enjoys the topic and care about his students;
great class;
Overall I was pleased with the class mainly lectures, some movies every now and then, and you don\'t need to do the readings. Sometimes it was hard to stay awake, but it got better as time went on. Tests were easy if you paid attention, and is very humorous. One of the negatives is that you now have to pay for the course packet, but overall great.;
Sadkowski is pretty cool. He likes to lecture a lot, but does include some discussion and movies. His tests are difficult, but he gave us all of our study guides on the first day. His papers are demanding though.;
Sadkowski lectures the entire class and it can get boring. There are only 4 exams and a couple of quizzes for grades and even with doing all the reading they were pretty difficult. He gave EC on the last two exams which was really nice. He is a nice guy and has some funny stories to tell at times. If you ask him a question he is glad to answer it.;
SHE IS AMAZING. Honestly, the most intelligent and realistic professor I have had. She is so smart and funny, I actually couldn\'t wait for class. She is so interesting and helpful, I will take her every chance I get!!! Love her!;
I really enjoyed Dr. Carnes class. The class discussions were always interesting, it was my favorite class of the semester. Tests are easy, do the study guide and you\'ll pass. I always made flashcards. You have to do a few article summaries as well as a end of the term project. Don\'t procrastinate, and sign up for the middle/end of the semester.;
I dreaded speech class and Laura made it fun. As long as you follow her grade sheet, which is very clearly laid out on what she wants, you\'ll get an A. You do need to KNOW your speech. She\'s a wonderful teacher, I miss her class even though speech is my number one fear!;
Need to show up to class. She gives random participation days and takes attendance every day. Reports are easy as long as you skim the material.;
She seemed a little nutty at times but she\'s super caring and sweet. I didn\'t pay attention in her class and still managed to get an A.;
I don\'t see why there is so much negativity. Her class is bearable and so long as you turn in your work and participate your bound to get a good grade. She is reasonable and offers great info prior to your essays. I would personally recommend the online class. I got an A in the class and did little more than what\'s expected of a student.;
easy A for sure, administered the wrong exam twice to us. still made us take the correct exams. I\'m sure she lost exam 2 because we still haven\'t received our grades & the semester is about to end. Gets off topic, definitely didn\'t feel like a 400 level course. She is a nice lady and accepts late work. 4 Exams;
No class will ever be harder than this. It is not difficult subject matter at all, but the format is bizarre and every point matters. The lab manual is full of typos and straight errors. The quizzes are over the most obscure parts of the lab manuals. Come to lab organized, study for quizzes, and don\'t forget LON-CAPA and you will be fine.;
Lee Grenci Taught me well. His classes were interesting, valuable for those who want to use the knowledge in their daily life. This information helped me during my career, with traveling, picking places to live, dealing with climate and understanding changes in climate and how the weather patterns affect us all. I am grateful to this man.;
Has a great knowledge of poetry;
Here\'s the thing;
Yes, it\'s possible to get an A but you\'ll definitely have to work for it. The content is pretty interesting, but you have tog get super organized in this class. You\'ll have multiple things due every week and a ton lectures to go over. If possible, I\'d avoid this class as an 8 week course. You\'ll definitely always have somethingto do in this class.;
Linda is the kind of professor that makes you love the subject. Grammar is tolerable at its best, but Linda made it interesting and fun. She is a very skilled instructor and she knows her subject matter. I believe attendance is key for receiving an A, but I never wanted to miss her class, so this wasn\'t a problem.;
She is like the little grandma that everyone wishes they had. She wants her students to pass and will help them make that possible. If she sees your effort, she will work with you. The whole semester was spent on writing the final paper, by building it piece by piece. She\'s funny and really helpful.;
She was a good english professor. There were times in her class where she loved talking about political and controversial things, which wasn\'t too relevant to english. But overall, she stayed on track. Her grading for papers is very fair and she gives great feedback on how you can improve. I would take her class again.;
I wrote my paper for this class before the semester started and did well with it. She gives weekly quizzes instead of something like 2 or 3 exams and it generally helps keeps people\'s grades up. She is the sweetest lady with a great sense of humor. She is very smart and fun.;
ENGL 1301 was by far my favorite of my first semester in college. Professor Mach provides her students with everything they need to know in order to be successful in her class. She is always there for her students, has a very clear grading criteria and is an overall exceptional professor. She has the best attitude I\'ve seen in a teacher. Amazing!!;
Nice instructor, will answer texts if you have questions about assignment. Grades based on 4 papers and journal entries. Does not require textbook, but will print out short passages for you to read. Lectures tend to be long, but she seems to care that you do well and provides you with useful feedback. Fair grader and opportunity for extra credit.;
Lectures are always interesting and well organized. Likes class participation but it doesn\'t guarantee you a good grade. Tough marker but her suggestions will make you a better writer. Be prepared to put a lot of work into assignments if you want to do well. Essay/exam topics come directly from class discussion so read the books and go to class.;
Mrs. Dameron is a wonderful teacher. She makes it easy and fun to pass her class. Anyone who need to take math class should take it with her.;
Ms. Dameron is very clear with what is expected and how she grades. She emails how-to videos regularly, provides good notes and worksheets, and offers online students to come to campus to study with that class for tests. She wants you to learn and pass. She\'s the best teacher I\'ve had at TCC.;
AMAZING. Very clear, easy work. 10/10 would recommend. Very nice, give A LOT of extra credit, take advantage! I would definitely choose her as my professor again. Tests are super easy and you have so much extra credit you\'ll always pass.;
professor Lourdes is a great teacher she cares about you, gives test but very simple, tries to be funny and the homework is very simple and its online. i recommend any one to take her. you do not need the textbook but you do need the access code.;
This is the best math professor I\'ve ever had. I had to take this class because I failed mat1033 three times, that\'s how bad I was doing at math. Now I got an A on her class. She is clear, teaches step by step, gives lots of extra credit, and gives an online review before every test. Tests are exactly like those reviews. I would take her again.;
This is the thing. Her class is so easy that it\'s boring. Also, if you are into meditating, this is your class (weird, I know). Lectures are on the internet;
Mr. Curtright is a very good professor. I have taken both World History classes and I loved them both. He means business when it comes to studying and paying attention in class, but he is funny and down to earth when you get to know him. Sadly, the Fall 2014 semester was his last one teaching at TCC. I\'m going to miss his class.;
Very great teach, sad that he his leaving. One of my favorite professors & he is truly hilarious.;
Boomin\' voice and great enunciation. Lectures at a good rate- not too fast & not too slow. Willing to always repeat himself to make sure you get the notes down. Very caring and approachable. Gives study guides and preps you well for the exams. Lectures are precise, but it\'s better to read the book too when studying for tests. BEST TEACHER EVER!;
I learned so much in this class. Potter is a VERY CLEAR professor, and is always there for students. I can\'t stress how much information I retained after taking this class. I highly recommend taking this class.;
This class was really easy! Potter is an easy teacher and there was hardly any work for the class, the only downside is you can\'t see your grade because he doesn\'t use Canvas but you can always ask for it!;
Took him in the summer and he was ABSOLUTELY PHENOMENAL. His grades are based on: attendance, oral presentation, 1 midterm w/ essay, and 1 final w/essay. Essay prompts are given 1 week in advance to prepare for. GO TO CLASS!! His exams are based on lectures. The book is helpful, not necessary. Loved his laugh and his personality. 3;
She great! I love her. She tough yet hepfull!!!!;
Dr. M. Jackson-Jones is the professor everybody wants. She is always on point, very knowledgeable, understanding, charismatic, and interesting teacher. I had her for World Literature and there simply isn\'t a better teacher. She doesn\'t play any games and definitely doesn\'t put up with foolishness. She gives and deserves respect. RESPECT;
She will give out homework, but she never picks it up. She will also tell us to not be scared to ask her questions but when you ask her questions she will explode and no answer your question.;
she will help you learn a lot about writing. you need to be organized and do your work.;
I love mrs Fitzpatrick psych 25. She\'s very caring a bit of a calling in sick but if you voice your concerns to her she will help you pick up grade. She\'s funny. her tests do match her 3 exams. a lot of reading. she lets you use a cheat sheet on test easy A. very accessible on line and in office. she\'s overall very relaxed happy all the time.;
Maria was the sweetest professor I have ever had. She was super flexible and understands that life happens sometimes. Sometimes was not super clear about criteria. But was fairly assessable outside of the classroom. Absolutely adored her and wished I wasn\'t done with my psych requirements to take more classes with her ! I took her at the RCC Campus;
Professor Fitzpatrick is awesome and really pretty. She really knows her stuff for all of her psych classes. She emails fast and answers all of your questions. I definitely recommend taking her for all of your psych classes.;
She\'s a great professor and her class is interesting. She offers a cheat sheet for every exam only because her tests are pretty difficult. She is a fair grader, however, she takes APA format very serious. If you make any mistakes on an APA format assignment, she will take many points off. Other than that, she\'s very clear. Offers extra credit.;
she\'s great. wants you to succeed. will help you if you ask for extra credit. very good lectures and good study guides. I\'ve followed her for my bio major prereqs. she likes you to be involved in discussion on the topics on the subjects of the day. love the team group testing gives the chance to build up grade. She\'s best teach ever for psych.;
I took her just for an arthumanities and since I like to write, I thought this was perfect. In this class we all sat in a circle, had group discussions, critiqued each other, and she gave awesome feedback. It\'s very open and laid back;
Took first online class and was amazing with Prof. Saunders. Gives great feedback and sufficient time to work on each paper assigned. Makes the online class interactive with the other participants. If you spend sufficient time on assigned papers and comment on other people\'s work you\'ll do well in this class. Responds quick to emails. Shes amazing.;
Great professor! Does everything possible to allow you to get an A! Really enthusiastic and loves teaching!;
His lecture are really entertaining and it\'s obvious he is passionate. However, if you do the reading yourself class isn\'t necessary to go to. As long as you review all of the vocabulary words the assessments are extremely easy- just study. Highly recommend his class.;
Professor Damen has a different way of grading- you earn points by doing assignments and taking tests rather than losing them if you get a bad grade. This makes it possible to get a good grade even if you don\'t do well on tests. He has a lot of guidelines for his papers. I really enjoyed his lectures. If you put forth the effort, you can get an A.;
Professor Damen is one of the most enthusiastic professors you will have. You can tell he loves what he is lecturing about and it makes the class bearable. He is clear on what he expects papers to look like, and what the test material will be on. If you need to take a history credit take this one.;
"Provides textbook for free online. A very easy ""A"" if you study for the tests and write the essays. Attendance is not necessary besides test and group work days because all the material and instructions you will ever need are online.";
Super enthusiastic, loves the stuff he teaches. I would recommend buying the class reader book in the bookstore--take notes on it in class, use it to write papers, and study the bold terms for 30 minutes before the test and you will get an A in this class.;
Very Enthusiastic teacher. He will tell you exactly what he will be covering in each class in the syllabus. ALL test questions come straight from the online text book. Put bolds the important words. You don\'t ever need to go to the lectures if you read the text book. I never did, but got an A. The text book is also an audio book.;
Good lecturer. The presentations do get dull sometimes but you can\'t expect much from the subject on databases. I had a clear understanding what would be on the exam and the grades looked pretty good. If you do the expected work then the grade should be high. The final project was rather interesting and turned out pretty well for our group.;
He is really nice at teaching. He won\'t mind at all even if you go and ask him the same thing thrice. TA\'s can be better. He grades well if you write your answers correctly. I amd my friends always scored more than what we expected.;
There weren\'t many actual lecture,since 80% of the class were presentations held by students. The grading criteria was very unclear, although he usually gave good grades. But be aware, all assignments were group projects with the same group throughout the semester.;
I think I took as many classes as I could with Dr. Tromp. She taught me how to write and how to think in the most creative and intense way. Engaging, intuitive professor.;
"Although she is pretty touch for grading but she\'s nice and really help you to learn the ""truth"" of how programming really is. If you are serious about your career as CS engineer so take her. I like her commitment in teaching. Overall, she\'s very helpful when you come to her office for help/need.";
She is a so so teacher. She truly cares about the students. Be prepared to learn the majority of the content on your own. I got an A in this class, she is a very easy grader. The people who said she was a tough grader and gave hard exams, are the ones who did not prepare. This is a tough subject, you need to study.;
She will give many extra credits. I think her logic and lecture is clear if focus on what she said, and no tired of questions. We have to be really careful with homework because of so many details. I learn preciseness and patience from her.;
McCluskey is the worst law professor ever. Avoid her at all costs. She can\'t complete a thought or give a straightforward rule. She never answers questions clearly. She took an interesting subject and ruined it. She makes you stand up when you speak in class, and nothing anyone says is ever good enough. I\'ve never hated a class so much in my life.;
Bakker is rude and condescending, but his class isn\'t too hard. He moves fast and doesn\'t thoroughly explain everything, but the book does and his tests aren\'t overly complicated. He does lots of clicker quizzes which can be stressful at times.;
Dr. Bakker gets a lot of negative reviews, but I absolutely loved him! He can be a bit condescending if you ask stupid questions, but do the reading and it\'s an easy A. He teaches straight from the textbook, so I recommend reading ahead of time then going to lecture to clear up anything that you\'re confused on.;
Dr. Bakker is a very tough teacher but he knows what he is talking about and will prepare you well for future classes if you put the work in. All the basics for the tests are in the powerpoints but in order to do well you need to do a lot of practice problems. Definitely don\'t take if you\'re just taking for a science elective.;
Dr. Bakker is very prepared for lectures and is great about answering questions in class and outside of class. He loves to see his students putting in effort, so go to office hours when you have questions and attend as many recitations as possible (his quizzes there help a lot, too!) Use all extra problems he gives and it will help for the tests.;
Martin is very difficult, so if you\'re not taking this for future classes beware. He\'s probably the best out of all 102 profs, but you need to do so many extra practice probs to pass. Study 1 week+ before the test, no matter what. He can be rude, but you need to put it the work. He is the best @ concept/math balance so if you need future chem do it;
Mary is overall a good teacher. You do not need the textbook just the lab manual. We almost never had lab or lecture quiz\'s even though we are supposed to. She gives out occasional extra credit. Ask questions if you have any because she is not the best at explaining things. For the practicals I would recommend using Quizlet to help you study.;
Mary is straight forward. She only teaches the material necessary. Quizzes are from lab activities done in groups so attendance is important to get these points. As long as you do the work and study you will do well. She has a great sense of humor and I really liked her teaching style. I feel I learned what I needed to.;
The best instructor I ever had, she makes learning easy because she makes sure you know the most important things. she focuses what you need know for real life and exam which makes grading easy. I got A in her class of Anatomy and you can also get that as long as you strive for it.;
McHugh is the best professor I have had at Merrimack. She is very passionate and respects everyone\'s view. Had her twice and wish I could take her class again.;
She\'s a really great professor. Her lectures are fun and she really wants to hear her students opinions in class. Gives very minimum hw and is easy to maintain your grade if you just do what she gives you. She\'s so active around campus and will be more than willing to help you in whatever you need.;
Had her for 2 classes in the same semester and I can\'t say I hated either. She wants you to be in class because if not she\'s not going over info again. She\'s funny and has a lot of experience in her field.;
She\'s wonderful! Lectures are full of examples in the management field as she has a great management background. 3 tests and a optional final but all come with study guides which are very helpful. 1-2 online quizzes per week but they are open note. 2 papers but not hard to write. She will help you outside of the classroom with finding internships.;
Amazing teacher. Ms Phillips has GREAT lectures. Don\'t miss them. She gives practice tests. Do them! The semester project was time consuming, but you learn a lot. Labs are fun, laid back, and fairly easy. Lab reports - follow rubric and you do fine. One of the BEST teachers at TCC. Five stars!;
"I enjoyed the class A LOT. The first couple of labs were a little confusing but after that the remaining labs were great. Professor Phillips was always well organized and always wanted her students to succeed. Even though I have not been big into science or biology, this class taught me a lot. Very nice and helpful when ""life happens.""";
"I LOVED Prof P. Her assignments were not difficult - film summary, labs were fun. Tests are open book for the most part. If you run into any ""life issues"" as she calls them, email her. She REALLY cares about you. Definitely best instructor I\'ve had online. Responds to emails. Did you know you can\'t feed your cat milk? Would take again, if I could.";
Mrs. Phillips is a very caring teacher. She will work with your schedule. Just ask. She loves biology and expects a lot. But, I appreciate that as a major. Keep up... take good notes. She is very fair. I loved the class and Mrs. Phillips.;
Mrs. Phillips was not the best at getting back to you on time via email, but if you stayed after class to talk, she is more than willing to hear you out and fix any problems your having.;
Prof. Phillips was an amazing teacher! If you put fourth an effort, you will pass. Very responsive on emails. Very good lectures. A wonderful Professor and person.;
Prof. Phillips was awesome! She is an extremely kind woman who will help you out if you ask. She\'s also very flexible with due dates. I learned a lot but there were times when I was just confused on what to expect/do. Tests and assignments weren\'t too bad. There is one big semester project that took up a lot of time. Take Prof. Phillips. Loved her!;
Prof. Phillips was one of my favorite professors I\'ve had so far! I took her blended Biology class, so I only saw her for a Lab once a week. The weekly workload was very clearly lined out and I knew what was due and when. She was pretty lenient on due dates if you asked her, and was always willing to help. I would highly recommend!;
Professor Phillips is TERRIFIC! She loves biology and cares about her students. She is knowledgeable and will try to explain things so that you can understand. Everything is posted on Bb, so if you miss a lecture, you won\'t get too lost. I enjoyed the labs and videos. I highly recommend!;
A very nice teacher. Helps you understand it and test are not very hard, but you must do your hmk to pass. Makes you study, but she is a very good teacher.;
He has you discover the chemistry. This has you understand why the rules are the way the rules are and understand why things work the way they do.;
Prof. Horn\'s class is extremely difficult. Group work every single day. Daily assignments can be confusing at times. Exams are super frustrating and hard. The worst exam set up I\'ve experienced at UVU. He seems super unapproachable in class. That being said, one on one, he is one of the nicest dudes. You can go to him and he will help you out.;
Prof. Burbank definitely knows his stuff. We always talked about current events for the first 20-30 minutes of class before jumping into lecture. His lectures are occasionally boring, but that was more the subject than him. If you read the text there isn\'t a big need to go to class.;
Had him for Intro to personality. His lectures are unclear. He goes off topic a lot. It was hard to grasp much in his class;
He likes to go on and on about his whole lifestory. Do not expect him to stay on topic. Most of the things you learn in this class will be from the textbook, not from him. He only took attendance 3 times so a lot of people skipped many of his classes and just did the readings. But he didn\'t assign any papers or homework. Other than that, he\'s nice.;
very unclear, long rambling lectures very self-centered man, lectures were 50% about himself and 50% about the material test questions had some surprises, content that you can be sure was never covered in class he is sadly nearly tenured;
Daily attendance. Grades aren\'t posted, so your grade is unknown till the end. Make sure you listen closely to lectures and take detailed notes. 2-3 quizzes a week. He spends class time talking about different essay topics instead of essay writing techniques/strategies, but if you work hard and follow his instructions closely, an A is attainable.;
"Definitely not an easy ""A"", but it is possible. Total of 8 Essays including the final the essay. There are pop quizzes but if you attend class they\'re not too bad. Attendance is absolutely mandatory! 6 absences and your grade will drop a whole letter, and there are no excuses, Smith isn\'t very understanding. Try toFind a different prof. if you can!";
I don\'t know why everyone else is complaining so much about this class. It is a very easy A. If you show up and do your homework you will pass. He is a very easy grader if you have basic writing skills (or just check your grammar with Grammarly). His class is incredibly boring though and there are daily quizzes (very easy though).;
Professor Smith will make you work for an A, but it IS achievable! Stay ahead with your papers, writing a paper the night before will not cut it. The worst thing you can do to yourself is skip his class. Pop quizzes are frequent, but easy if you take notes when he lectures and review them!! Put in the work, you will do great!;
Smith is a very unemotional/robotic professor. He is a decent English professor, but he expects professionalism out of his students. There are pop quizzes at least twice a week, but they are always very easy. Do not get caught procrastinating on your papers because he catches small mistakes very easily.;
Can use book/internet/whatever on exams. Check BB before class, cancels frequently. Also, dismisses early every day until end of semester. Child Development was an easy class with her. It\'s an easy A if you know how to write papers well enough.;
She\'s a modern superwoman, juggling a PhD, a private practice, and some 3 classes? Extremely kind and easy-going. Very intelligent and thought-provoking. Always left feeling like my mind had expanded a bit. Tells great stories and examples. If I had met her earlier I\'d probably pursue a career as a therapist. You get what you put in as always ....;
He tells you what you general things for tests and gives handouts. Pop quizzes are on vocab that you have to define from the book, and aren\'t really random, he tells you the class before to study. He offers help. When it comes to tests, study everything and know little details especially for short response questions. Tough grader, NO extra credit.;
I loved Professor Arminio! Although he is tough, it\'s because he wants students to understand that college isn\'t supposed to be easy. But he is kind, funny, and when he lectures, he takes his time to make sure concepts are understood. He expects you to do a lot of studying on your own however. Would take again. So sad that he is retiring. :(;
Professor Arminio is awesome. He explains topics very well, has flexible office hours for extra help, announces exams well in advance, and loves to give pop quizzes. These quizzes aren\'t really pop though, as he always says to expect one soon. Arminio, also, gives great advice about future schools to apply to. Overall, he is THE best.;
Dr. Ballard is a very interesting person;
He\'s a good teacher. He really cares about everyone he\'s teaching and gives over some valuable life skills and tips. He\'s also very interesting teacher. funny.;
He\'s a tough grader, will call on everyone for answers, and expects you to act and think scholarly. What\'s wrong with that, though? You\'re in college and that too a senior college and not community college. If you can\'t handle basic studying then real life\'s got surprises for you. Be ready to work but also be ready to learn.;
Absolutely loved Prof Chaney! He\'s super hilarious, and he knows what he\'s talking about within the film industry. Do your work and you will get an A! There\'s two film individual projects ( midterm and final ), so it\'s not bad! He loves when people participate and talk in the class though not many talked in our class (maybe because it was an 8 am?);
chaney is amazing!! had him for an 8am on a monday and he made it totally bearable! he is hilarious and gives you a lot of creative freedom! take him !!;
Chaney is super cool! Took him for intro to screenwriting. He\'s relatable and understands his students. He\'s really good with feedback on your scripts. Sometimes he can get distracted easily and it can be annoying but his distractions make class interesting! Would totally take him again!;
Chaney was an absolute ray of sunshine! His Film 100 class is fun and chill. I had him for an 8am and every morning he made waking up for that class a little bit easier. We only had two projects and spent a lot of time talking about and watching films. He loves when people talk in his class and he is very excited about what he does!;
He\'s probably my favorite professor at SCAD! He knows what he is talking about and is very helpful and is great with his critiques. He tells lots of stories, sometimes they\'re relevant, sometimes not. I would definitely take his class again!;
The Best Senior Project Prof. And the hardest to get. He has tons of knowledge.;
Kwag is a very knowledgable professor. His lectures are always interesting and if you are willing to work and participate in the class you can learn a lot and do very well. He genuinely wants students to succeed, although he may be strict at times. He is always available for help.;
I took PSYCH 337 Comm. & Society w/ Prof. Milburn (online). The material he provides is very interesting and I really enjoyed the class. He is extremely responsive if you ask him anything which is great. The class is very straight-forward and what is expected of you is laid out clearly. The work load is fair, & if you do the work you will do well.;
Challenging class but smart and funny teacher. You must READ the book and take careful notes on how to do the exercises on the quizzes and tests. If you memorize the definitions and follow the examples, it\'s not that hard.;
Knows what he\'s talking about. Everything is explained on the syllabus. You have to read the instructions and follow them. If you don\'t follow instructions, you lose points -- no duh. Not confusing if you know how to read. If you ask questions via email, he responds.;
not bad.;
"For the first test I was furious, I studied hard, read all assignments got barely C. I found what he is looking for, I got A. Pay attention what he said "" this will be in test"" or "" on the test I want you to draw the diagram"". He said those when students having hot debate. I did all the extra credits (3).Ask questions, be prepared, be creative.";
Hard course, but an excellent professor who clearly knows what he is doing. It is a challenging course, but if you put in the work then you will do fine.;
I loved this class. Mr. Dinneen knows his stuff, and presents it in a way that actually makes it interesting. His tests are not easy, but he gives several opportunities for extra credit towards the end of the semester. I really feel like I learned and retained a lot of information in this class. Show up, take good notes, and you\'ll be fine.;
He is a very sweet professor and does a great job to make sure we pass while understanding all of the concepts. I loved his class.;
It was a good Excel class. I entered without knowing how to use Excel and this class helped a lot. You can complete your assignment at home and print a screenshot of a part of your work to turn in the next class. Attendance is taken every class. I learned a lot overall and I enjoyed this class!;
What can I say that hasn\'t already been said? Mike is a wonderful guy and a great professor. Designed the entire course and materials himself with the students in mind. Essentially a self paced class. I actually learned a ton of great excel skills too! Imagine that, a course that is low stress, relatively easy, and where you learn valuable skills.;
"Monica is by far the worst employee at UVic. She is rude, unclear, and makes these labs as hard as she possibly can. I get why, it\'s to ""weed out"" the weak students who shouldn\'t be furthering their degree in Chemistry, but she makes it miserable to want to pursue, even if a student is capable enough. I received an A in 101, and am taking 102.";
She marks hard but consistent. When I asked for feedback on a grade I found harsh she willingly set up a meeting and explain where I lost points and how I could improve. My lab marks significantly increased following this meeting. I found her very helpful if questions were well thought out and relevant.;
Dr. Sharif comes to class with problems to work out. These problems are almost identical to the online homework. However, he often makes mistakes/gets confused with his own work. This can make the class confusing. His tests are very similar to the homework. Make sure you actually know how to do the homework and not just copy it from your notes.;
His accent is difficult to understand and it\'s not helped by his incredible messy handwriting. You\'ll have to teach yourself the material out of the book. He\'s also very condescending to anyone who asks a question. He gives a lot of homework, but it\'s not too tricky. His tests are almost always just like his review questions, which is nice.;
His lectures are not very helpful with his poor handwriting and angry demeanor. He was not very helpful during office hours. He posts online notes that are typed and easier to follow along. He does offer good review before each tests to give an idea of what will be on tests. Lots of homework but only worth 5% of grade.;
I loved this class. Dr. Sharif has an accent which takes a few days to get used to but he has an amazing teaching style. The majority of lecture is him working out problems by hand. Before each test he does a review of 3 questions which are EXTREMELY similar to the actual test questions. He gives tons of partial credit and always wants to help.;
Not a great teacher and the accent doesn\'t help, but lets you know what to expect on exams and the final. He\'s the one to take for fluids. Attendance isn\'t mandatory, but you have to go in order to turn in HW (5% of your grade) that\'s due every lecture.;
Not the best in lecture. Be sure to pay attention during his review classes before exams as they always give the exact problem types that will be on exams. Typically curves the overall grade at the end of the semester as most students do poorly.;
Professor Sharif teaches fluids in a very straightforward way. He holds review sessions before exams that are very similar to the exam itself. Homework is due every class but is only worth 5% of the final grade so doesn\'t hurt too much if you forget a few assignments. If you study the review and homework problems before the tests you should be fine;
Sharif was a great choice for fluids. He was very clear in grading criteria, explained things very well, and kept the class moving at a good pace. I took the class during the second summer term, but even though the class only lasted about a month, the work required to do well in the class was very manageable. I would recommend taking Sharif.;
Murphy always talks about football and never mentions anything about biology. He has confusing lectures but I will admit that his powerpoint short video presentations are ok. His test are very hard and if you play football he will pass you reguardless so unless your an athlete I dont reccomend this class.;
"Nancy would ask us to explain some phenomenon, and we would always say ""shielding"" (which was the correct but lazy answer in every case), and she got wise and started requiring us to defend that answer. Since then I\'ve never given an answer I couldn\'t defend, in any medium, on any topic. 4 instead of 5 for defriending me on Facebook.";
Not good at lecture. Makes material more confusing, than needs to be. She is very accessible and will work with you, if she see\'s that you are trying, which is her best quality! On exams, tends to put material that was briefly discussed.;
Barden is amazing, he explains micro without torturing you like some other teachers. He is more keen on you understanding the larger picture and wants you to apply logic also during his exams. I loved his lectures, his hilarious so that helps, and always open for you to pop up during office hours for extra clarification. Hands down my fav prof :);
Barden was by far my favorite teacher. He is hilarious and makes microbiology interesting, easy to understand, and lectures aren\'t boring. You DONT NEED BOOK. All tests could be done right off of his slides. Amazing professor.;
lectures are helpful (majority of what is covered in lecture will be on the exam), he posts study guides & past exams to help you prepare for each upcoming exam, there are many extra credit opportunities- if you don\'t take advantage of it there\'s something wrong with you.;
Ned is an easy professor. Just review the slides before the exam and you will get an A. He gives numerous amounts of extra credit. If you pay attention in lecture then reviewing won\'t be much at all. There are old exams and study guides to prepare you. Easy A;
One of the easiest classes at mcp as of yet for me.. 100% would take him again if I could! I cannot recommend him enough. Study the slides and you\'ll do great on the exams (all MC). Extremely easy A. Lab is also much easier than freshman bio labs!;
Professor Barden is amazing, lots of extra credit provided and gives awesome memorable examples, which helps to understand the material and that\'s how I studied! Awesome professor!;
Environmental Hazards is a great class. Should be renamed to search and rescue. Dr. Heywood brings alot of experience to the class from his navy days. He is a great person to talk to and to get to know but be warned hes a talker for sure.;
Heywood is a great guy. He is full of knowledge and his passionate about the subjects that he teaches. All of his test and quizzes you can do by yourself or in groups on your own time outside of class. He gives you them a week ahead of time so you don\'t have to cram for anything. He tape records all his lectures and powerpoints and puts them on D2L;
Labs are short. Tests don\'t really cover what is covered in class. Textbook is not used.;
Phenomenal professor. Lectures were easy to listen to and fairly interesting even if geography isn\'t your favorite subject. Helpful guy. Test\'s and quizzes are all online and they are fair. Highly recommend Heywood if you want a nice grade in a 5 Credit course.;
Very good teacher, highly recommend him as a teacher if you have to take Geo 101, he makes the work easy to understand and worth learning;
Great prof.;
I am a recent graduate, and Nina was my saving grace at CMU. She provided creative outlets through choir, and challenged me to be the great musician that I became over my years as a vocal student. I had several voice teachers, but Nina was the one that taught me the most about music and responsibility. Do yourself a favor and join her choirs.;
Nina is the greatest choir director I\'ve ever had. She cares about everyone\'s input and does everything she can to get the best sound out of us possible. In order to pass, you have to show up - but that\'s a given in choir. And if you have too many absences, she offers extra credit by attending festival choir. Amazing person and professor! Love her;
I took the radio astronomy course with Professor Bartel and I have to say he is one of the best profs I\'ve ever had! The course is very math heavy but if you do the assignments, ask questions in class, and listen to his lectures, you will be okay. He makes the material so interesting! You\'ll definitely learn something. Absolutely recommend Bartel!;
Patient and always provided extra information for those who were more interested in the science aspect. It was a great course.;
Very good professor! His lecture is REALLY interesting, and he cares about his students. Have any question? just ask him. Be sure to attend class and read his notes, almost all of the test question come from his notes. If your answer is really good, he will give you extra mark.;
Good Teacher. Make sure you go to class because the problems she reviews in class are the same on the exams and she DOES NOT RECORD HER LECTURES. There are 3 Exams, Mastering Physics Homework, and a Final Exam (which is cumulative ). Exams are all Multiple Choice, some true or false.;
If you don\'t go to class, don\'t expect to do well, even though attendance isn\'t mandatory. It can feel like a waste of time, but if you bother listening, you\'ll understand the material better especially come time for the final. If you do well on tuneups and the appendix hw then you\'ll do fine on exams and the final, they\'re exactly the same thing.;
I don\'t fee like he actually knew much about the subject. (Drugs and Behavior) he read directly from the powerpoint. He never was able to properly answer questions from students when they came up in class.;
Dr Arrey is an extremely funny and smart professor. Many people find him to be mean, but he truly wants everyone to pass. His class is extremely hard, but its pretty straightforward. STUDY EVERYTHING IN HIS PACKETS;
Dr. Arrey is a great professor, and one of the best I have ever taken. His class is definitely tough, but as long as you work pretty hard and go talk to him in his office when you have questions, you won\'t get anything less than a B+.;
Dr. Arrey is the best professor I\'ve ever had. No other professor has ever given so much of their time to help me succeed. Accelerated ochem 1&2 are no joke but if you put in your time (at least 5 hours/day), go to office hours, and participate in class, you can get that A.;
After repeatidly taking this course, I took this professor in the summer & got an A. He lectures from the moment class starts to a little over the class end time. To take notes I used my macbook and found it much easier to follow his layout! FOLLOW HIS LAYOUT & Study his notes in the layout he gives 6 hrs a day, his test come straight from notes!;
Dr. Nicoletto is an amazing professor! I highly recommend him, and would take him again. He is inspirational, and is always available to help. You do have to show up to class because his tests are all from his lecture. He posts PP\'s on BB with illustrations, but he doesn\'t post his notes. Must study daily, but thats with any science class.;
Although this was an easy class, Prof. Pam occasionally went off topic throughout her lectures and was sometimes confusing to follow. You don\'t have to show up to class, just read the books and complete the essays/ online assignments. Online assignments are credit/no-credit so just try to do them and you\'ll get the easy points. Last daydonuts so..;
Easy class, readings are sometimes confusing, but just do your best. Email her for any concerns or questions, she is approachable. Overall, do your best and it should be a chill class;
One of the coolest professors I\'ve ever seen. PHIL is not my thing but I took her PHIL101 for GE purposes. Her class does NOT have any exam including final. There are about 3-4 essays that are fairly easy. They have deadlines but u can turn in anytime u want without getting any penalty. She grades not hard too. 100% recommend to her class.;
Pretty chill teacher. No late policy so just turn in assignments by last day of semester and you are set. As for attendance - leeeel whats that. only went 5 times Difficulty of class: easy. For 2 creative projects2 agora days - just turn in and free 100% For 3 short essays - actually put some effort into it and you\'re good.;
"Pretty easy class as long as you actually put some thought into the essays and reports. EXTREMELY nice and helpful professor. Attendance is not ""mandatory"" however she did take attendance daily. Lectures could be pretty boring, but they\'re helpful when you don\'t understand the material. All the lectures consisted of her explaining the reading.";
Professor Hood LOVES her In-N-Out! Throughout the semester, she used burgers and donuts and used them to make philosophical arguments, which was pretty hilarious!! Though her lectures DRAGGED on and were most of the time boring, i still learned some interesting stuff when i read the book and wrote the essays. Do your best on the tests and papers!;
Professor Pam is a riot. She is energetic in her lectures, providing thorough explanations to make an interesting topic much more interesting. I didn\'t go to class the last two months and still got an A. Easy easy A, you can learn a lot if you push yourself and do the expected work. If you don\'t, you\'ll still get an A.;
SWEEET LADY that loves her In-N-Out! I\'m not into philosophy.....and this class made me not want to take interest in philosophy even more. Class was boring and i didn\'t attend 80% of the time, except on test days. Passed with an A because i actually did a bit of reading for the tests and i took the assignments seriously!;
Wow, what a teacher! Cumpton makes English fun again. Yeah, you still have to write, but the assignments for both classes are simple and clear and she allows you to turn in writtings again.;
Great prof. He really made me think about life and how I think about things. He challenged me to venture outside the box and question what I believe and why as objectively as I could. Really showed me how closed-minded I was. This class is a must for first years. Essays aren\'t hard. Just incorporate what he talks about in lecture. READ THE BOOKS!;
Class is INTENSE! Omg I had to work my butt off for an A. Lots of papers to write & her directions aren\'t very clear. Bunch of discussion board posts to make to. If you think this is a blow off class think again. You have to put in ALOT of work for this teacher. I managed to barely streak by with an A. I would\'ve been happy with a C in this class.;
I liked her, her instructions were detailed and it was easy to do an assignment then look at the list and check them off. She wrote up her own material which was easily printed off from canvas and her video lectures could be listened to on mobile app. Topics changed every 2 wks but I promise, you will learn so much. Do all extra credit.;
This class will kick your butt! With that being said, you will become a better student because of it. Instructor is very very knowledgeable and has fantastic real life stories to share. This class requires a lot out of you, tests are far from easy and the countless papers and online classroom discussions will require a lot of time and committmen;
Mrs Zrolka is the best math in GSU Decatur take her you will not regret it. She gives out review for every test, all the quizzes are take home assignment. The test is not difficult if you study ahead and complete the review. she gives out extra credit, and the best part is she is so orangized. She is willing to help so use her office hours.;
Mrs. Zrolka is the best, if you come to class, take notes and pay attention you shouldn\'t have a problem. If you\'re really struggling she is always in her office ready to help but you have to put in the work. If you\'re not a strong test taker or have a hard time grasping the material then you need to be her best friend but she will help you.;
Now known as Patricia Farrish, Amazing professor. Laid back, understanding, makes class fun, light work load. and you actually learn. Reviews are exactly what is on the test, nothing will blind side you. Attendance is not mandatory, but I enjoy being there. This goes for ANY class she teaches. I\'ve taken her any chance I get.;
He is very boring, soft spoken and likes to ramble. He talks so slowly yet quickly that it\'s hard to decipher the gibberish that he speaks. His slides are not great either. Keep your studies to the textbook.;
Senior Seminar is over the top as far as assignments go - it\'s total chaos. Overall, though, he\'s a good professor and he\'s very reasonable when it comes to grading. If you\'ve met the requirements and you\'ve demonstrated that you\'ve done the work, you\'ll do fine. He\'s also a good advisor if you\'re a journalism student.;
Knows his subject very well. Really cares about writing & literature. Very fair with grades.;
this guy can talk his butt off. half the time i think i\'m philosophy class instead. hardly any use of any text. all discussions which i guess is good for a liberal arts school to a point but he\'s out of hand.;
No Comments;
Great guy, a bit monotone though. I\'d definitely recommend his class;
There is a lot of extra credit and he is very fair in the grading criteria. He is super sweet. If you show up to every class, you get four points on your final average. Would take him again!;
Overall good guy and fun to talk to. However, his art knowledge is primarily based in the late 70\'s/80\'s and says all art is cyclical and therefor has no need to go to see any new art because he has already seen something like it 20 years ago. He claims to retire every year for the last 10 yrs and it shows so get it over with and hire FRESH.;
she is the so great! very helpfull and a loving personality! I\'m even taking her 122 class for spring. ( its hard to get in her class b/c it get filled quikly so hurry if you want her) strongly recommend her !;
Her class is a lot of work, but it wasn\'t as hard as I thought it would be. Show up, start assignments/projects early, study for tests, and ask questions if you need to. There are 11 pop quizzes, but they\'re only 2 points each, you get to take them with your group, and she checks them over before accepting them. No reason not to get full credit.;
Nice prof! For exams, just study the notes & UNDERSTAND everything (don\'t memorize). Her tests are more applying what you learned than memorizing, but VERY doable if you study. While studying think of examples of the content and how you can write about things talked about. The semester long group project sucks IF you have a bad group.;
Teacher has a great attitude and is very helpful but many times is disorganized and assigns reading that you simply will not have time to do. You must go to her and ask specifically what will be on the test because if you do ALL the readings she assigns, you will literally have no other time for any other classes. Syllabus is sometimes a mess.;
Course is listed as online but should be shown as hybrid because you have to go to campus for tests. Have to email her multiple times before receiving a response and by that point it is too late. Uninterested in helping students in anyway. Horrible at clarifying what needs to be done. If you take her course you will regret it.;
Conti was such an amazing professor because he attacks the real problems of the world and allows us to break those barriers in class. In the 2 hours I had him a weak because I took a hybrid, I learned about current events, how to write, and general knowledge I need to succeed in life. Conti was a life-changing professor.;
I took his online class, which was not easy. There was a lot of reading and you HAVE to be on top of everything. It is easy to forget to do assignments when you are taking class online. However, Prof. Conti made the work interesting. He is not a piece of cake, but he gives you the grade you deserve!;
I took Peter Conti for both ENG111 and 151. This is a hybrid class, you only meet in class about 6 times for the whole semester. He is a tough grader and expects a lot from his students. He takes no excuses and if you don\'t do your work don\'t expect to pass. but he is a great professor overall I really did learn a lot from him.;
Professor Conti is equally impressive as an educator as he is a cool dude. He doesn\'t BS- BS probably isn\'t even in his vocabulary. Extremely down to earth but a tough grader. As long as you do literally everything he expects you too you will get at least an A-. He doesn\'t hand out A\'s easily but he is a fair grader.;
This class was the main stress of the semester I hated it!! He thinks because he knows the subject everyone else does ! He makes you feel so stupid! He doesn\'t give good instructions! I worked my ass off and stressed more than I should have. Honestly take another professor spare yourself the trouble .;
Dr. Foreman is a teacher that actually cares about your education if you do. The material can be difficult, but if you put in the effort and study you can get an A. He is easy to listen to during lectures and the course-work (for me) was very interesting. Pretty funny guy too!;
A really great teacher that really cares about the subject matter and his students!;
Although his lectures are long and dry, Dr. Geib is good guy. In this class, you will give 2 presentations, write 2 research papers, 2 terms tests/essays and 2 essay tests. He\'s super flexible and willing to help his students.;
Dr. Kuhlman is a great professor! He is helpful, willing to make time if you need assistance, and is really clear on what he expects of you.;
Easy A!! Take home midterm and final, easy essay question you can just google!;
Straightforward, clear, provides good lectures alongside films relating to the subject matter. Show up to class, sign in, listen and learn. NO tests, NO homework. Take home midterm and final papers as well as attendance your grade for this class. Pezzolo is pure class.;

Phil White is honestly the best CS professor I\'ve had at RIT. His style of teaching is excellent and really helps you get a thorough understanding of the material. He is a very fair grader and is clear with his expectations. He is often blatantly sarcastic and has a good sense of humor. Overall a fantastic professor!;
Phil\'s tests are tough but if you work on the labs and projects you can make up for less than stellar test grades. He\'s a fun lecturer but does digress from the topic sometimes. Overall, I enjoyed his class.;
He is an awful teacher. Cancelled class so many times in the semester with short notice without approving it through the department. Assigns essays which are very subjective and unclear grading. Wouldn\'t recommend him.;
Dr. R is a gem in the EM program. He is a tough grader and is picky about what he wants, but he makes you work for your degree. Honestly he is not exactly an expert in the field of sport and music management but he will try his best to help you out and find people that can answer your questions. He really cares about his students. Get to know him!;
He is so unclear about what he wants. He actually told us what he wanted for a project presentation, then counted us off when we presented saying he didn\'t tell us any of those things. He has no idea who you are even if you want to think he does. He could care less about you. He is the only teacher so it made me want to change my major.;
I had this professor for my stats class! In all honesty I struggled a bit but with A LOT of studying outside of class, I managed to pull an A thank god. He was a kind teacher who did care for my grade and if you put in the extra effort, will reward you greatly! He gave lots of opportunities to better test scores.;
A+ prof. Get ready to spend all of your time on the homework assignments (worth 40% of the semester and are insanely tough). Tests are OK. Don\'t skimp out on the assignments.;
best prof ever;
Great professor. Easy assignments and exams. Required very little studying, but was still very interesting. Would highly recommend.;
He really has the right way to teach. His presentation of the material is simply efficient. I could understand everything the first time. The assignments and exams implied more thinking than actual writing and were sometimes challenging, but always rewarding.;
Love him;
Very clear and efficient at teaching. It took me some time to fully understand recursion, but after I got it, it was really easy. IT\'S JUST BLACK MAGIC! Final class average should be at least B+;
Amazing professor has a bit of OCD when it comes to papers and how he likes it done but a lot very easy very lenient and gives you opportunities to make up your assignments.;
Charismatic man, do all of your work (essays and academic marks) and you will pass the class. You will not dread going to this class rather you will be excited to go.;
Don\'t take this class if it\'s to fulfill the requirement. Instead come to class with an open mind and make the most out of it. Don\'t miss class, DO the work, ask questions, and you\'ll be just fine. Really smart dude that actually knows what he\'s talking about.;
He is a professor that actually makes you think, in a good way. His lectures are the ones that when you finish them, you want to tell your friends what was discussed. Strongly recommended.;
i would take this professor again if i could. hes an amazing teacher and makes lectures very interesting and fun. you\'ll learn alot from his experiences and classwork. would definitely recommend. only 3 at home essays and 3 in class essays. he takes away the lowest grades from both. easy A and lots of fun;
I really wish some other professor would teach Intro to Global Studies. I was forced into taking Ghorashi for my minor. His lectures were rambling and vague. 90% of the class time was spent doing 20 minute presentations that weren\'t explained very well. Honestly, they just felt like an excuse for him to have us teach the class instead of him.;
No textbook necessary for this class. Ghorashi lectures the entire class which can be boring but he is very clear and always asks if everyone understands because all test and quizzes are based on notes taken during lecture. He revisits previous lessons at the beginning of class. A quiz every week, midterm, and final, rarely any homework.;
"quick 2 question quiz every friday. 15% of your grade is participation!!!! Dont bother buying the textbook, I never opened mine!!!! For any open ended question he asks in class, answer ""IT DEPENDS"". 99% of the time you\'ll be right! midterm and final are questions very similar to the quizes! Take clear notes!";
"So much pointless busy work. weekly journals every week, 15 extra homework hours of ""research"", two 20 minute presentations, and basically none of it was necessary. I have no idea what this class was supposed to be about.";
Echoing another review, Ms. Edelson takes her students\' work seriously. She spends a lot of time editing essays and helping her students develop their ideas. She has an unimposing brilliance that inspired me to produce some of the best essays I have ever written. I would recommend taking this class solely for the collage essay.;
I CANNOT RECOMMEND RACHEL EDELSON MORE HIGHLY! IF YOU TRULY CARE ABOUT LEARNING, TAKE HER CLASS! I had the privilege of taking ENG1A at SCC while in high school, and it saved me from absolute depression about school. In marked contrast to the stultifying English classes at CKM, Edelson really engaged and supported our critical thinking and writing.;
Ms. E was truly one of my favorite professors of all time. She really was able to make me think out of the box and fill my brain with knowledge about things that are never really spoken about. As long as you do all your writing assignments every night, which will be assigned every single night, you will pass the class without any problems!;
Need to get sophomore English out of the way? This class is a really great way to do it in 6 weeks over the summer. It\'s a lot less stress to write many short, not style heavy papers over the traditional long paper. You\'ll have fun and get to meet others through interaction and discussion unlike the normal class.;
Rachel Edelson is easily the most engaging, inspiring English teacher I ever studied with. Her classes aren\'t easy, because she respects students enough to truly challenge them\xe2\x80\x93and herself\xe2\x80\x93to grapple with complex themes and reading material. As with any great class, you\'ll get what you put into it, so do yourself a favor and give it your all.;
This is not your typical English class. Instead of dreary lectures we had riveting class discussions about shocking issues. In place of monotonous grammar homework, we had assignments that required opinion, thought, and action. Ms. Edelson has an unrivaled passion for teaching that is evident in her class. Without doubt, I highly recommend her.;
This was one of my favorite courses. Edelson is an invaluable facilitator of education. We begun the class by improving lexicon and even covered how the words one uses changes perception of one and also how one perceives the world. There was never a dull moment, never a time when I felt the mechanisms of my mind not being utilized.;
Radhika is intelligent, charismatic, and tough. She\'ll push you to think about race and gender in a new way, and she\'ll push you to do the work. This is not a class you can skate by in without doing the reading, but putting in the effort is worth it. She\'s a great instructor, and the class is enlightening and entertaining. Highly recommend.;
"She is one of the hardest graders ever. She makes fun of the journalism degree constantly and says that she\'s going to make us work ""twice as hard"" when we come to her class. Her assignments are ridiculous and she makes it very difficult to have a good grade in the class without staying up all night to finish her assignments.";
Not a good professor for the course.;
Professor taught us well. Hr was very fluent and nice.;
Amazing professor! FIN 301 is a difficult class but she explains everything so well, you barely need to go over it in the textbook. She is very accessible outside of class and will see you at any time you need! Tests are difficult but she scales them and she gives you extra credit. She takes pride when you do well in her class!;
Professor Luther is one of the best Business professors Salem State University, if not the best. She personalizes her teaching to suit each class and individually each student. The information I received from Professor Luther is unmatched by any professor. She helped me get the information I needed to get an internship and is not my advisor.;
Was definitely a hard class, but you will learn a lot. She teaches at a fast pace and takes attendance every class. Assigns a lot of homework but doesn\'t check it until the end of the semester for extra credit. You will need the textbook. she assigns homework from it and quizzes us on chapter reading for participation points;
For me, she is introverted professor but she is very warm hearted. So far, I really like to go in her class (because I study, she explains well and the works are always done on time). Her teaching skill is professional. She knows what students need to pass this course. Participate in class, ask to clear sth u dont know and kill the quizes and exam;
"I like this professor. She is clear in the class and willing to help students who do not understand. ACC220 itself is a hard course. You need to pay attention. If you show up every time and ask questions, you will get an ""A"".";
Easy class and lab. The lab kit is ridiculously expensive. $60 for a box of basic stuff you can find at home - straw, clothespin, etc. Lab manual is $100, only difference is the lab sheets are different color. Easy A if you just need class for general education requirement.;
He\'s hilarious man. I enjoyed attending his classes. I highly recommend him for non-bio majors.;
Hilarious guy!!!! Must take! This is a GPA booster. I had him as an online class and I was cracking up while reading the study guide! Take him!!;
I highly recommend this online class it is pretty clear and easy A. Do the work and you will get the grade. Prof suggested to get mylab but didn\'t use it at all. the discussions req. are clear and easy. The prof is understanding and works with you on anything without out double questioning. Awesome Teacher! for being online.;
I took both Biology 100 and the Lab. You CANNOT use Used Lab Manual & Kit. You have to buy new each semester because he uses different colored lab sheets. Labs are easy. Be Careful if you search Google for answers because some are wrong. Rent textbook instead to save money. Very Easy class overall but it won\'t help you if you are science major.;
I took this class these past 8 weeks in the Fall of 2017 and I thought it was going to consists a lot more work like people were saying. Honestly, I learned a lot from the labs we were assigned and he strongly believes in all students! There is nothing that couldn\'t be possible in this class. I would highly recommend him to anyone! Thanks again!;
It\'s up to you if you want to get anything out of the class. It\'s so easy. Just do the work and you\'ll get an A. The lab can be harder.;
Lectures and important facts in seaport are a must read. The book isn\'t very well written but you will need it for some of the tests. This Class is straight forward weekly quizzes a midterm with essay and a Final. I highly recommend Professor Warwick I like his straight forward approach.;
Super easy but be ready to sit in class while he rambles about things that have absolutely nothing to do with biology or your lesson.;
This is a non-major Biology class. This is a free-giveaway course just to boost up your GPA. Just take it and you will get an A. Lots and lots of extra credit.;
Really cool guy... and a great teacher. i think i learned more in his class that in anyother science i have ever taken. and it was fun and easy!;
No Comments;
"Take this professor if you get the chance. This course is an easy ""A"" and at the same time you really learn a lot. This Professor teaches in a way of his own and it is a course that I will never forget. I drove from Pensacola Beach to Milton just to take this class and it was worth every mile! Professor Wolf loves his job and it shows!";
get ready to take notes. he writes them all on the black boards and doesn\'t post anything online. If you miss class you wont have any idea what\'s going on unless you go to his office hours;
great teacher, going to his office hours is very helpful because he is willing to go over and workout any problem you ask him too. lots of homework but it prepares you for the test. pretty funny. tests are based on the homework, very fair grader. . don\'t skip class. this class will not be an easy A. study and do your work and you will get an A.;
Hes a thorough instructor. If your a math or engineering major hes your guy. If not, like I am not, then he is not your guy. Got an A but he defiantly makes you work for it. Will ensure you are prepared for future math classes.;
Incredibly helpful if you have questions.;
"There was a major lack of communication with this professor. She did not return emails and seemed very confused about grading. I would not recommend her. If you can find another professor for this class... go with it. She takes weeks to grade and is very ""last minute"" about it. I paid for her class and yet was never able to communicate with her.";
Dr. Bodek is very knowledgeable and his lectures are filled with anecdotes and details, they\'re very pleasant. Just keep in mind that you must take notes at all times because there is no textbook for the Weimar Germany class, other than two compilations of readings.;
Rich Bodek is the best teacher at this school. He is so intelligent and passionate about what he does and gets really excited when students are engaged. He really cares about students and doesn\'t have tests or quizzes, you just have to read every night. Its such an interesting class and he really makes you want to learn.;
HE IS A GREAT TEACHER I LOVE HIM........;
I love this teacher. I took three semesters with him, if I have any math class I will take with him with pleasure :);
One of the best math professors there are .;
So, I just want to say that Burns is an awesome teacher...no doubt about it. His love of math makes the class interesting. You know he enjoys what he does from the way he acts. He is always smiling and is very easy going. He has solved difficult problems in front of the class. Very impressive! Side note...he is an avid player of chess! Pretty cool.;
(Taken - Fall 2014) I was so happy to have a professor like him in my first semester of college. He is hilarious. He\'s fun to work with. We did research, which was super fun! (My class got to do research on sex work comparing different groups of people);
Brilliant. And open to non-traditional approaches (fiction, plays, whatever) to the third year paper.;
Deviant Behavior was the best class I\'ve taken at Assumption. The class is very easy for the most part because you are studying how people defy norms in society. Gendron\'s lectures are AWESOME. Best I\'ve had. He gives examples with the notes WHICH ARE ESSENTIAL for your in class essays. Overall, amazing professor, and great class.;
He is a cool guy and he is a fair grader.;
Dr. Dukes is always available to help and shows genuine interest in your research topics. He explains complex things in a clear way, but you do have to pay attention so you know how to ask the right questions. His notes are much more helpful than any textbook he assigns.;
If you can take Dukes and avoid Lofton, DO IT. Your life will be so much easier. He is a great STATS teacher and I hated the subject. He is easy and helpful, and it is nearly impossible to get an A in any other CJ STATS course.;
This professor has an innate understanding of the American government and taught it in a way that students could relate to. I really enjoyed his lectures. I came into this class prepared with a notebook, thinking that there\'d be a lot of PowerPoint notes I\'d have to write down, but I was mostly just writing down quotes of cool stuff he said.;
very hard marker, but you will learn alot, excellent teacher!;
Very clear. Makes sure everyone understands. Listen in class and do the assignments and you\'ll do great. Also make sure to ask if something is not clear.;
I really enjoyed Dr. Sowell\'s class. She is there to help her students and cares about how you do in the class. You have homework every night and tests are weighted heavy, but if you do the homework you should to good on tests. I would recommend her!!;
If you at least attempt all of the homework, you\'ll do fine in Dr. Sowell\'s class. The start of each class will be spent going over homework and this is where most of the learning takes place IMO. As a teacher she was fair, respectful, and very accessible to all of us. My only complaint is that we ran out of time near the end and had to rush.;
I took this course last year and it changed my life, because he sort of became my mentor, and I\'m just one of many mentees. It\'s easy to do well in his courses, but seriously if you show him effort it will be the best decision you ever make. Fun, funny, chill, helpful, and super well connected.;
Bob is awesome, end of story. Take him and don\'t look back. Makes a tough subject easy. Lectures reflect the test directly.;
Has around 11 blogs and group presentations. Allows the blogs to be revised for higher grade. Grades fairly and offers extra credit. Be prepared to read a lot and participate in class discussions. Blogs make up a large % of grade.;
He\'s tough at grading but makes it clear that he wants you to write well-written blogs that look professional/interesting and prove that you\'ve read the texts and have thought critically about them. He\'s British, so his humor is rather dry and sarcastic--I loved it. Very nice as long as you are respectful.;
Super great professor. Makes expectations clear, is very willing and wanting to help students. Explains concepts in understandable and constructive ways, can\'t get much better.;
BEST PROFESSOR. He is an incredible individual and my favorite at DePaul! Take him!!;
Dr. K was awesome! He always kept my interest and made a Thursday night class tolerable, which is really impressive.;
Dr. K\'s class was awesome! I learned a lot about Catholicism. He is a very down to earth guy that understands students. He shares some very interesting stories and real world examples during class.;
Dr. Karpinski made it clear during his first interaction with the class that he was there for the students. Although it was an easy class, he made sure that the students got the most out of each and every class through participation, great reading material, and discussion.;
Highly recommend taking his class at DePaul! Encourages participation and makes everyone feel included!;
Highly recommended to anyone! Dr. K is literally one of the coolest professors I have ever run into, mainly because he is just a wonderful human being. He is so intelligent and so compassionate and he understands the way that education should work. I wish I could have him for more classes. If you are a smart cookie you will take his class!;
Overall interesting class. Take if you need to raise your GPA. Pay attention and turn in your assignments. Give effort in this class and you should get a A or B.;
Professor K is an angel from above!! He is such an intelligent man. He does assign a lot of papers but it\'s worth it because you actually learn! The readings are interesting and so are his lectures. He engages everyone to participate and keeps an open mind during discussions. Keep up the great work! Here\'s your chili pepper, you deserve it :);
Dr. Stecker might be the best philosopher on campus. But note that that doesn\'t entail he has the best pedagogy. I recommend visiting him during office hours. He\'ll give feedback on papers, and he\'s often willing to have discussions. He seems to want his students to be the best philosophers they can be.;
Often hard to understand because he is constantly mumbling and even confuses himself on various topics;
Professor Stecker is one of the sweetest professors you could ever get. He loves the material, he cracks jokes, and he does a lot to help you out and also get to know you. As far as the class goes, he will assign a reading, read it before class to get the basis of knowledge and the next day he will go over it with you so you understand.;
Reynolds is the best. Super sweet, helpful, easy class. Very accommodating to late papers.;
Not a class for people who don\'t want to work. If you want to sleep through class or expect him to give away grades... choose a class that you can pass without learning. He will explain concepts over and over until everyone understands. Take him if you want to succeed in nursing.;
Prof Strong is an okay professor. I found his lectures unclear/confusing. I basically taught myself by reading the chapters, going over the ppts, and creating my own study guides. His tests are tough, study everything!! If you ask for help, he is willing to help though. Lab practicals are easy if you study and go to the tutoring center.;
Best teacher I\'ve had a Wesleyan. His enthusiasm for the subject was infectious. I went into the class thinking I was going to drop it because the first reading seemed dense but he manages it to make it interesting and enjoyable. As long as you do the reading and take advantage of office hours when something is unclear, you\'ll be fine.;
Lectures are very boring/useless. I just read the book. Doesn\'t know the answers to his own questions. Assigned us a whole project (that was not in the syllabus) 2 days before the first part of it was due. Very vague in what he expects of you and if you ask questions he just rephrases them and makes you feel dumb for asking in the first place.;
The class is hard if you don\'t read!!!!! That\'s pretty much it, if you are interested in learning (which is why you should be in college) then you\'ll enjoy him. I also went to the Rome trip with him, same work load. He\'s worth the time and $$$.;
Awesome!;
"He gives unclear lectures filled with off-topic interjections and ramblings. PPT slides directly copied from the textbook are used for ""lectures"". Boring classes with zero group projects, no creativity. I often walked out of class due to being so frustrated. I barely studied and still gots A\'s on all my papers and midterms. A total waste. Avoid!";
Rudi is a very nice professor who is passionate about his work and cares about his students. You will be required to attend 2 out of 3 field trips. They get a little long but are actually pretty fun.;
All in all, a great professor. While her tests can get rather hard, she gives bonus points to make up for it, and even once gave us 25 bonus points on a 100 point test. There are only three tests and a final. If you work hard and put in the effort, you will easily get an A. She is willing to help you. The only way to fail her class is to be lazy.;
I think it says something that the positive reviews all have negative user reviews whilst negative reviews have positive user reviews. This professor is just awful. Stay away from this class. I recieved an A so I am not just complaining. Her teaching style is godawful. Many people drop out of the major cause of her. Awful role model.;
I\'ve had her for two semesters now. Her lectures consist of showing us various definitions and examples, but not really explaining them. I had to learn most things by religiously examining the textbook and watching videos online. Going to class always felt like a waste of time., but it\'s required. Expect to be confused every class period.;
She knows her stuff and is very helpful. CS lectures can be boring, so no surprise there. Learned a lot, but I wouldn\'t take her unless you are a major. Overall very personable and sweet! Would take again;
I would be lying if I said he was easy. But his personality is the besy! He hates kids, which will become apparent through his sarcasm and comments. He is a genius. And I personally think he is very attractive. As for papers, be prepared to cry and know your topic won\'t pass him off before you pick it. But if you get on his good side he will help!;
I had prof Fenton for algebra. She lectures over everything you need to know, but moves very quickly and if you slow her down she will make you feel dumb for asking a question. If you pay attention, show up for class, and do the homework its an easy A.;
I wouldn\'t recommend this class if you know you are not great at math. She moves really fast. If you slow her down by asking a question, she\'ll make you feel stupid.;
Don\'t like her much. Picks her favorites and sticks with them. Such a young teacher, but acts like she\'s 87 years old.;
Great guy, really cool...class was easy and you learn from real world experience. got A- :-);
machine learning;
Definitely take her class for ENG 095. As long as you attend class, do your work and polite to her, she will love you. Papers are only a page long and your final is a group project. Easy A;
Dr. Brown is one of the most passionate professors I have ever had. She loves modernism and postmodernism and it shows! I learned so much and was able to apply what I learned in other courses. It was a fun, easy class and I would highly recommend taking a course with Dr. Brown.;
Dr. Sandra Brown is such an exciting professor. I took her for Modernism and will definitely take her for Postmodernism. She has great passion for the material that she teaches. It\'s a rarity to see these days. I def. recommend her for the Humanities courses. As for grade, it is whatever you want (no tricks). 4 quizzes, 4 short papers, very doable.;
Professor Brown is all over the place. When being assigned essays and such, we were never given a concrete answer of due dates or when an assignment was due. 95% of the time, the class was confused. No note taking, only watching YouTube videos and being tested on handouts. I didn\'t enjoy this class in the slightest.;
SHE IS THE MOST EASIEST TEACHER EVER. Seriously, if you have to take ENG 095, take her. Everything is easy, the papers only have to be a page long, very nice. I absolutely recommend her. She is a bit crazy and most immature people can\'t tolerate her, but if you want an easy A, here you go.;
Dr. Tjandra is the best chemistry professor I have ever taken. His lectures are very good. He uses a combination of powerpoint and boardwork to explain his topics and he does this very well. His tests are tough and the lab reports are long so make sure that you are studying and have the time set apart for this class. Super time-consuming.;
Excellent professor. Makes chemistry very simple to understand. Can\'t say more, just an AWESOME professor! (Textbook is only used for homework.);
He was the first science professor I had at Chaffey college. He was amazing. I had never taken chemistry previously and I passed his class with an A. He gives lots of hand outs that really help with understanding and does a lot of in class activities. I would recommend him. I wish he tought 24A and 24B;
Good proffessor. Straightforward on all tests, just take LOTS of notes. Book tests are EASY. If you take notes you don\'t really need the book.;
She co-taught the class with Dr Melendez. As a result I believe most people compare her to Melendez. That being said many dislike her because she doesnt spoon feed you everything that you need to know for the tests (which Melendez does). But if youre willing to pay attention during lecture and actually work a little for the class she\'s a great prof;
She is amazing. She came around to every single recitation to try to get to know her students ( enough said). she will always be there for you to answer any questions you have and will defiantly try to curve your grade up (a bit) if she sees you\'re hard working and diligent.;
Dr. Bergeson is a fantastic professor, he is able to teach difficult subjects in a gripping way. He cares about his students and knew a substantial amount by name (in a class with 100 students). Lectures are interesting, and despite first appearance, the vigorous testing and homework schedule is actually very manageable.;
Dr. Bergeson is a great professor and lecturer. It was in a large class but still individualized it by letting students ask questions and help with examples. The lectures are based on enhancing the textbook reading, so if you read the book, you\'ll be great.;
Good if you are prepared to take responsibility for your learning and review a lot outside of class;
I dreaded Physical Science before the semester started;
I loved him. He requires 95% for an A, but that\'s because his teaching style makes it so possible. No curve. He has 8 short quizzes (sometimes in groups) rather than large tests, a few short homeworks per week, and iClicker questions in class that are participation-based. Does everything he knows how in order to help his students truly learn.;
Professor Bergeson is an entertaining lecturer and his class is set up to help you succeed at physics. You will have to learn some of the material yourself as not everything is covered in lecture. Go to the TA lab if you are stuck;
Taking Physics 105 from anyone else would be a mistake.;
Whether or not you like him will depend on your style. Dr. B gives a lot of hw and tests frequently. This is actually helpful because you get a lot of opportunities to make corrections to your grade. 7 or 8 tests total, 3 of which are in class with a group. He talks a lot and often doesn\'t finish lecture, so prepare to spend time in the TA help lab;
I was very turned off by this individual. Too bad he\'s very very opinionated and can\'t take a question for a question and not an attack on his views. I\'m dedicated to trying to make it through my college career without having him as a teacher.;
Class is fun and centered around discussion. There is a lot of reading but you\'ll want to do it for the discussions. Other than participation, the rest of the grade is papers. If you like to write and discuss philosophy, this is a great class.;
Just a solid guy.;
So passionate about the subject and his students. Just a really good professor.;
Attendance counts for points. I finished the class with 89.99% but he gave me an A- cause I was always there and participated. Four papers, six tests (online). Cumulative final. Tests can be kinda vague, so definitely study. Textbook really comes in handy. Dr. Peters is a really nice guy and a decent professor.;
Class consists of six exams and two papers. Hefty reading assignments and no break between exams. Tests are online but are very difficult. Final is cumulative. One of my favorite professors on campus and one of my fav classes. Wish I could take more classes with him.;
There are a lot of readings outside of class but he covers the main ideas in lecture well. Papers are pretty big but manageable and he leaves feedback in a timely fashion. I feel like I learned a lot in both Law and the Courts and Law and Politics and would definitely recommend those classes.;
Hafeez is extremely sarcastic and a bit stubborn but overall a good teacher and is willing to answer any questions you may have. Poppers every class session, but are easy. Homework and EMCF due every week, 3 tests and an optional final to replace lowest test grade.;
I am currently in 1311 online with professor Hafeez. The class layout is very clear. Email response was ok at times response were short & unclear. More importantly, this was an easy A, if you do the homework, take every quiz and remember the poppers. There are several opportunities to do well. I have never been a math person and I did very well!;
I took her course online and although I didn\'t like the online aspect, I truly loved her teaching. She is very funny and caring of her students. She will stay after class hours and help those who need it. I selected lecture heavy because it\'s all online so it is, lol. Watch her lectures, do her work, & the test will be very easy! An A is possible!;
Not a very good teacher. Lectures are long and you walk away learning nothing. Don\'t take her - I respect her origins, but she has a heavy accent and it\'s quite hard to understand her sometimes. Also, she is BAD AT MATH. Makes MANY mistakes and often confuses the entire class. Stay away from her if you\'re taking her in a big lecture...;
Profesor Hafeez is an okay math professor. She knows the material pretty well. The only reason you need to attend class is because of the poppers. If you don\'t get something you can always ask her questions.;
She tends to be unorganized, messy with her handwriting and unattentive to the blackboard chat when we, as the students, try to correct her. It was to the point where I actually had to not go to her online class anymore because all she did was confuse me more than she taught me. All in all, I got an A by self-study and teaching.;
This online class has lectures twice a week. There are pop quizzes (poppers) in every lecture, practice exams mimic the real exams and your grade on the practice gives you extra credit toward the exams. You have 20 attempts to get 100 on your quizzes and practice exams. You have the option to opt out of the final if you maintain a B or above.;
Shane! This guy is the best! He\'s one of the funniest teachers I\'ve had. This class is known for a high fail rate, but Shane is very helpful and wants you to pass. If you do not show up to class or do the exercises, you might fail, the content is not super easy, but manageable if you put in the effort. Hell of a guy, tough course. Go to class kids.;
Shane\'s a hilarious teacher, he always wanted to take the time to help out students do the best they could. If you try in this class its an easy A.;
Gadbois gives you the best feedback on your exams because she goes through each short answer question and we exactly she was looking for. Also the night before the exam she has group chat online so you can ask her any last minute questions you may have which helps everyone so much! Definitely taking more of her classes in the future!;
Gadbois is entertaining and easy to listen to. As long as you commit to learning, she will do everything she can to make sure you are successful in her courses. Fair grader, gives lot\'s of feedback and even outlines for her exams. I LOVE her! Almost makes me want to switch to a psych major so I can continue taking her courses.;
Shannon is probably the best psych prof at BU (however my 2nd and 3rd choices are right behind her!) She always tries to make examples relatable so you are able to remember them better! She also tries so very hard to be available to you and correspond to your needs! If you have a chance to take a class with Shannon, do it!!!;
Very straight forward, blunt at times. But its strategic, and she truly is a remarkable prof and genuine person.;
She is such a flake and a complete airhead. She is aggervating & annoying. Dont take her class. you will want to hurt her before it\'s over;
He was hard, yeah, but this is college. Differential equations is not supposed to be a walk through the park! I went to every lecture and asked questions. I would spend hours every day at the library studying for just this class. BUT, again, this is college;
He\'s a smart guy but cant teach at all. He does meaningless confusing proofs the whole class. The two comments below are tripping. If you do get stuck with him just watch Professor Leonard on YouTube, he teaches the same material. I strictly watched his videos and took notes and finished the class with a solid A.;
It is pointless to go to class, except for the weekly quizzes at the end of class. Just teach yourself from the textbook and work through problems. His tests are easy because the questions come from the textbook. The department final was also pretty easy, but I would say this class is easy for those who can self-teach.;
Very smart guy and lenient with grading. Didn\'t show up to class very often, although I kept up with the homework and stayed on top of my stuff. Even though it might be hard to understand him at times, I\'d definitely recommend him.;
I had her for ASL 1 and 2. I wish I could have her for my teacher for every class. She always gives good feedback. She also tells stories along with vocab to make it easy to learn. She also taught us how to still use signs even if we do not know the exact sign by description. Best teacher I have ever had from kindergarten to now. She really cares.;
I absolutely loved her. Her lectures were interesting and I actually enjoyed going to class. The down side is that there are quite a lot of papers assigned throughout the semester, however she does a good job with feedback in order to improve your grade. I did find that she can be a tough grader but if you put in effort you\'ll do fine. I got an A;
He is VERY specific on how assignments are completed. Make sure you complete 4 initial discussion posts b4 deadline, retake exam tests-he gives unlimited attempts. You MUST be DETAILED and give essay answers in your OWN words!! Class is not hard, but requires lots of time/effort. Fair/lenient grading, IF you follow directions, and he offered E.C.;
I took her online Development Psychology course. It was kind of hard to stay on top of the assignments. She would make a lot of things due on one day about a month ahead of time and let the students do it as they pleased. Some may like this approach, but I found it difficult to remember to do assignments until the last minute.;
So glad I read his reviews before I started work in his class. If you take him make sure you are detailed with the module questions (I mean 15-20 pages per module) and only use his links to answer the questions. He gives unlimited attempts on tests, so take advantage! Be active with discussions too! Class is a lot of work but you\'ll learn a lot.;
pretty good;
The class was too easy and very poor by college standards. I transferred to a better school after being disappointed by how juvenile the course is. The professor, while friendly, comes off too self-centered at times and not very knowledgeable.;
:(:(:(:(;
Ah, Dr. Rorke, the gatekeeper and decider for all things WHP. Although he can be intimidating and expect a lot of students, he is overall consistently clear on expectations (as long as you know where to look). New students: heed warning and check all syllabi posted on the WHP section of the Oakland website. The answers are there - just read.;
Dr. Hupp is amazing! He cracks jokes in every lecture that are actually funny, his grading criteria for the paper is literally step-by-step, and I actually learned a lot in his class because his lectures are so engaging! Great choice for child psych!;
He is amazing! He knows what he is talking about and is so funny that you want to pay attention and learn.;
A nice guy with a dry and sarcastic sense of humor which I liked. He gives you the questions to the quizzes and tests beforehand so you can just do them on your own time with the textbook and then copy them down in class from your notes. Make sure you keep up with the journal questions. If you don\'t understan your grade he\'s helpful if you ask.;
I would recommend him. Expect homework but it\'s very manageable. If you do the work you should be able to easily pass. He is upfront about what quizzes are over and midtermsfinal.;
One of my favorite professors at CState! Highly knowledgable, helpful, friendly, and hilarious. Preparation, homework, and reading are essential. All quizzes/exams are in-class essays, but he gives you the questions ahead of time so you can prepare, and allows you to bring notes to the exam. Take if you want to learn, look elsewhere for an easy A.;
The workload is a ton. Usually three assignments (which take me a few hours each) per week. On test weeks you have all of those plus an essay test. I don\'t even know how many days worth of hours I spent preparing for the tests. If you\'re up for a difficult course, go for it! However, if you have a pretty bulky schedule I would not recommend it.;
Looking back at it, I loved this class! But he does get off topic and is a little confusing and eccentric. All his tests are take home and you can always go to the tutoring center for them but he has links online that will help you pass easily. He is an easy grader and really loves his students. If you get on his good side then you will love it!!;
Do not take this class if you just want to learn regular guitar, not just nylon string. This class is classical style only. You need to take 83A instead, there you can play acoustic or nylon string and you\'ll cover several styles. In Jones class, you have to play exactly how he tells you, so if you can\'t change your playing way, you won\'t be happy.;
He has a lot of heart and loves to teach. He will make you an outstanding classical guitarist and a great lead guitar player if you play steel guitar too. Just be open to his teaching method and put in the hours.;
One of the finest teachers at PCC. If you are at all interested in classical guitar, I implore you to take his class.;
Prof. Jones is an excellent, passionate classical guitar teacher. He teaches music theory so you understand it too. His class is for CLASSICAL guitar, so be serious and open to this method. He knows what he is talking about and there is a reason why you must do it as instructed, it will all make sense when you advance to the more elaborate pieces.;
As always, he doesn\'t do much to mislead his students. He tests you on what he says he\'ll test you on, save for about 10-20 points of stuff that isn\'t on the review to see if you really learned anything and didn\'t just memorize the review. It is very easy to do well in his class and the graduate students love him.;
He\'s a good professor, some people just misunderstand his intention because he does get annoyed easily but he doesn\'t mean any harm, also know who you\'re audience is every graduate student loves him(graduate center) but undergrad students who are bad at math don\'t like him.;
He\'s hard to understand when you first start the class, but then it gets easier. His tests are exactly the same questions he did in class and on the review day. You don\'t need the textbook.;
His lectures are awful, take for an easy A not if you want to learn anything.;
Mitra is very knowledgable in Math. One of the smartest Professors around. He does get little annoyed when students ask him questions from previous courses. He expects you to know everything. However, His reviews are similar to exams. So do ll the class problems and review, you should be fine! Not a real tough grader. Gives lot of partial Credit.;
American Literature after 1865 is the second of two classes I took with Professor Lape this summer. I greatly enjoyed this class because she helped me grow as a writer. I especially like how she lets students pick the topics of their essays (related to the assigned readings and approved by her). I would reccomend that anyone take a class with her.;
I liked the course more than I liked the professor. Professor Lape rarely updated announcements, gave no feedback on anything, was not professional with her email responses, she did not help me much with anything really, and she was too subjective with a lot of things. The class was pretty easy, but she barely did anything all semester!;
I took two online classes with Professor Lape this summer, and I wish I could take more. I greatly enjoyed this class covering women\'s literature. Participation is in the form of Blackboard posts covering that week\'s readings. Papers are returned (with great feedback) within a few days of submission. I became better writer because of her.;
It\'s a lit class so there is obviously a lot of reading. Dr. Lape does a great job of explaining things. She is very easy to get along with. Participation in discussion is required but she welcomes all thoughts and does not put anybody down. She is also funny which makes literature not so boring. Would take another class by her again.;
"Online summer class. Syllabus was clear about what was expected. 2 essays and 2 exams throughout the entire semester. Discussion board every week. Professor Lape posts ""weeklies"" which are summaries of the chapters required to be read every week. Gives good feedback on essays. Lots of reading, but easy A if you put in the effort!";
Professor Lape is such a sweet lady. She helps you understand the readings the next day you come into class by discussing with everyone. There are not many grades. Attendance does matter to her. There\'s one group project which could go either way based on the group you choose to be with. The exams are a little rough to study for, but you do well.;
"She is the best teacher I have ever had. She gives you a ton of control over your writing assignments and really wants you to find your own ""writing voice"". I would definitely take any class of hers. I looked forward to English class every week.";
Took the online US Literature I course. Very well organized, had the entire semester laid out by the first day, which made it easy to plan ahead. Her weekly outlines were a lot of help as she helped break down the assigned readings. I did enjoy being able to pick my own topics for the two essays that were assigned. Dr. Lape is great!;
Dr. Parker is a very nice lady, but this was the worst class I\'ve taken at UA. If you are a business major, do not take this class. You\'re much better off taking an entrepreneurship class in the business school, you\'ll actually learn something relative to modern day. The 2.5 hour class is all lecture from slides you could print and read yourself.;
Sue is very kind and is always willing to help students. The class is very easy: you basically just write 350 word papers each week about the reading and talk about it in groups. The exams are written and there is a final paper and essay exam. Overall, the class is easy and definitely interesting even if you do not care for literature.;
Truley an ideal teacher! Really laid-back, funny, and super nice! But be prepared to write cuz thats what the class if based on...just 5 write-ups of your choice out of 10 & a final paper on a book you read. Pretty simple. I definately reccomend him...if you don\'t mind writing a little.;
Dr. Larkin is simply the best PED Prof. in PED at John Jay! I have taken 2 classes with her. She is excellent! Take PED 110 ONLINE with her it is an easy A, forget what the other people say. Se gives good feedback. PE Minor students should take her! Forget these other teachers, (they are too serious) she is the best one to take! Easy A;
Dr. Sue is mad chill! Take her, Easy A. She talks about good stuff in a health class for adults!;
Although I don\'t understand music nor have I ever taken a music class, she made things very simple. The only way you wouldn\'t pass this class is if you didn\'t do any of the work. If you put in the effort, regardless of your test grades, you WILL pass with an A;
Class was filled with fill in the blank notes and that\'s all you needed to study and fill out the study guides with. Tests go along with the study guide and there\'s even a review in class for extra credit. She\'s helpful but a little sassy. Online homework was super easy too, it didn\'t take long at all.;
Great class. All you have to do is show up and pay attention (make sure you get the right notecards). I went to a performing arts school in middle school so I already knew most of the things but she does explain things really well and she is willing to help if you dont. The class was with about 200 other kids so go to her office hours, if need be.;
Lindahl was a great professor to have for this class. You are required to go to 2 concerts for the class throughout the semester, but less than other mus114 professors. If you keep up on the online quizzes (you can always get 100%) and do the extra credit youll be totally fine. She really wanted her students to succeed and is very helpful!;
Pay attention in class or get notes from a friend and you\'ll do fine. There are in class quizzes at the end, but you can use notes. 3 tests, 2 concerts and 1 project all easy to get A\'s on. She is helpful if you email her or talk to her after class. Boring class, but super easy A.;
Prof. Lindahl was great. She knew that almost the entire class was taking it because it was an easy UP. Easy homework- online music guides that had to be completed in a week. No reason why you can\'t get an A. All the answers were in the book, so the assignments were very easy. She\'s a great prof. if you don\'t understand music, as she makes it fun!;
Professor Lindahl was an awesome professor. She is very passionate about music, and it makes it easy to put in the effort. If she can tell you are trying you will get a good grade. Attendance is highly recommended.;
She isn\'t the most sympathetic professor, but it is so easy to pass the class. She offers so much extra credit and you can take the quizzes until you get 100% on them. Show up to class though because there are little in-class responses that add up to 150 points throughout the semester. You have to attend 2 concerts and write about them. Overall OK.;
She was awesome! Doesn\'t take attendance, but does in class responses randomly. Easy A if you have the notes. Exams you can use a notecard, so it isn\'t too bad. Plenty of opportunities for extra credit! Would definitely take her again.;
Super easy class for nonmusic majors. Definitely have to put effort into studying for exams if you want a good grade but there are a lot of easy points in the class to boost your grade if you don\'t do well on the exams. Tons of extra credit points (I went into the final exam with over 100% in the class). Online HW due before class is easy.;
"Very nice professor that offers LOTS of extra credit, even free points on tests (ie. ""just mark A""). If you\'re struggling, which shouldn\'t happen much, she is very accessible for office hours and gets back to you frequently on emails. Topics are also interesting and easy to learn also it\'s just music and learning to appreciate it. Fantastic class";
I\'m not even sure if easy is the word for her class. As long as you turn in every assignment and look at the book/notes during the online tests you are basically gaurenteed an A. Also make sure to attend as much as possible that is part of your participation grade. I did everything the day it was due in her class so I\'m not joking.;
Ms. Mulcahy is a very good art/design teacher. She is willing to help and is very clear in what she expects from each assignment. Since this is a design/art course, you will be doing many different projects throughout the semester, so it is in your best interest that you go to class!;
Professor Sailors is great. All of her assignments are pretty easy and you can tell she knows the subject very well. Make sure to complete the assignments and do the discussion participation. The quizzes come straight from the book. Take her if she is available.;
*shudders;
he\'s very cool, his labs are great. but he actually said in class one day that he was so monotone that he was putting himself to sleep. if you take his class, you\'ll learn as long as you are drinking a ton of coffee;
Assignments are heavy and instructions are walls of text. Exams online are difficult with fill in the blank answers that must be exact. This is a good class if you want to be a secretary, and redundant in Word if you take INFS1010, another required class. This class should focus on typing only. She makes assumptions about disabilities (arthritis).;
Professor Sparks is an absolute delight, and her classes are highly informative, intellectually stimulating, and fun!She has a sophisticated veneer, but is actually incredibly warm (more so than most other professors) when you go to see her in office hours, and really validates participation in class.Tough but fair marker.RECOMMENDED!;
Hard to understand, but it\'s math and he writes it on the baord so it\'s ok. Teaches the subject well, and he\'s kinda goofy so it makes class interesting. good teacher overall;
I took professor Usyk this summer for statistics and honestly can say that I grew and learned a lot during my time in her class. Her lectures are easy to follow and she explains things clearly. She is straightforward with her expectations. Yes, she expects a lot from her students but she also is willing to help if you put in the neccessary effort.;
Professor Tarkow makes any topic interesting. I had him for two separate classes, and it was obvious that he really cares about his students and his classes. He can explain any concept and make it easy to understand, but he also pushes you to discover things for yourself. You get out what you put in, so definitely do the required readings.;
It is mandatory to take religion at Bryn Athyn and I did so without the best attitude. However Thane and The New Church\'s approach to religion is thoughtful and inspiring. It is quite evident that Thane really cares about the material he is teaching and the students. I am a better person for having had this class.;
He\'s smart and he\'s funny. It sounds like his undergraduates don\'t like him, but we have a pretty good time in the grad class. He\'ll legitimately care about your interpretation and he\'ll make you think.;
I enjoyed this class. There\'s 5 modules and you get 3 weeks for each one. There\'s a few assignments, a blog post, and a quiz each module. Totally doable amount of work. Only thing is, for the blog you need to work with your group and a lot of people wait until the last minute. Cooke was very helpful and informative either way. Highly recommended!;
I took Dr. Cooke\'s URBN 1200 course online over the summer. Dr. Cooke is pretty knowledgable and It was an interesting course. There was no textbook and he just had you do assigned readings on HuskyCT. Your grade was based on 12 writing assignments and your comments on other student\'s assignments and he dropped your two lowest scores.;
Professor Cooke cares about the subject and the students, but is extremely disorganized. Overall the lectures are interesting. He is a harsh grader, but curves the grades a lot. The textbooks are completely unnecessary even though he made us buy four of them.;
This was my second class with Prof. Cooke and I can\'t say he was much more organized than the first time. Prof. Cooke means well and is a nice guy, but he just seems all over the place and not clear on his assignment requirements.;
Fall 2013 night class.He speak Cantonese, Mandarin, English and post solutions online.His notes are organize.He don\'t check homework, but give you quiz(total value 30% final grade) from homework problems. you could use a formula paper in exam.Final exam is open book, notes, so print all solutions from his final review and at least read them once.;
No exaggeration when I say Mr Hu is one of the best teachers I\'ve had. Calc3 is not easy and it covers many topics, yet I was able to work the hw based almost entirely on what I learned in lecture. He\'s engaging, caring, hilarious, and approachable. He makes himself available outside of class and is responsive to email/phone. He is rooting for you;
Really good teacher, tests aren\'t that hard, just a lot of material to go over. Pretty funny guy.;
A lot of effort is needed to pass his class.;
Excellent professor! This is the second course that I took with Professor Schnarre (intentionally) Very fair and keeps you entertained.;
I have taken 2 classes with him. Awsome teacher! Makes class fun, and different than others! Gives you plenty of time to work on papers. Papers are not long, but detailed. Follow directions to a T.;
If you pay attention, turn work in on time and follow his instructions you will breeze by. He as a wonderful professor and keeps class entertaining.;
Iv taken two online classes with Thom, and have nothing but success in both of these classes! He is very understanding and flexibility on late work. Although I was in condensed classes over the summer, I didn\'t feel rushed.;
This class was TOUGH. I pulled numerous all-nighters to be able to pass. But, he did help me become a much better writer for the future and with taking 106, I don\'t have to take anymore english classes. On my final I thought I did really good but he marked me down, and till this day I don\'t know why!;
Thom is a very interesting guy. Be prepared for that most of all. His subjects, in my opinion, are a little dated but they are pretty easy to write about. He\'s a tough grader but if you know how to write, this class will be a breeze, just be prepared to work at it.;
A fantastic professor. I wasn\'t looking forward to SOC theory at all and with Dr. G it quickly became my favorite class of the semester. He is passionate Sociology and wants to see his students succeed. He treats you like adults and gives it to you straight. Great guy. Would take him again and recommend him without a doubt.;
Dr. G does an excellent job of making students feel validated and important to lectures. Allowed lecture to get derailed from time to time simply because we had a strong interest in a topic and he enjoyed seeing us work with the material. Great use of examples and doesn\'t ask you for too much. You get out what you put into this class.;
Dr. G is a fun professor who loves sociology and helping students learn to love it as well. He really cares about his job and it shows. I would 100% recommend taking him if you have the chance. We had 3 exams, all online and pretty easy if you do the readings and go to class.;
Dr. G is fantastic. He makes you feel validated and respected as a student. He never talks down to anyone. He keeps his lecturing as interesting as possible (it\'s still theory) and tries to engage students in the discussion. You can tell he puts his heart into his work and really wants to connect with the students. Take him!;
Dr. G is the man! I took this course online over J-term, but he was still very helpful. Read the instructions and do exactly what he is asking for, and it is an easy A.;
There is three exams, all online, and two one page single spaced papers. I didn\'t read the book once or any of the assigned readings and did just fine. You do need to study for the exams, but if you take notes you should be fine. He can get sidetracked and sometimes the lectures aren\'t that engaging.;
I really enjoyed my class. Tim was very helpfull and the guidlines were clear. Wish I could have him for my next english class.;
Show up and pass, easy grader, be sure to review powerpoint slides before tests and you will pass.;
This SFI class was definitely my favorite course from my first year at SSU. Tim offers really interesting and inspiring points of view, gives really awesome lectures, and is working for the good of his students. The class depends on the books, films and short stories, but its for sure fun and interesting if you put your mind and heart into it;
Tim\'s a cool professor who cares about his students, -sometimes really hard to reach outside of class. Lectures felt very long sometimes because he tends to talk a lot sometimes, but makes them more interesting with visual aids. There\'s a lot of reading that we did, but he breaks it up so if you keep up you\'ll be fine! Looking forward to part 2/2.;
Wouldnt take this class ever again;
Professor McCauley is the best professor I have had York. He posts his PowerPoints which makes it easy when studying for the mid term and the final. After taking this class with him I switched my major to sociology. If you have a chance to take a clas with him take it. He is knowledgeable and definitely knows what he is talking about.;
Could not write any faster. Very unhelpful, poor attitude towards teaching probably wanted to be something else than a teacher. Childish in his actions and word. REALLY BAD TEACHER;
Get on her good side, she is full of connections;
Very nice woman. Projects are fun and easy to complete (IMO). Always there for students, but sometimes to the extent of being a pushover re: due dates and quality like most of Mercer\'s art courses, critiques are too lax and the quality of work is severely overrated. She is also the advisor for the Graphic Design Club.;
I feel like I actually had to work for the A in this class for both the exams and the speech. So if you are taking a lot of classes and you want an easy A for speech, I suggest you take this class over the summer because you are required to work hard for the A. Also, you have to practice for the speech to get a good grade as well as read the book.;
I have extreme anxiety when it come to talking in front of people and it wasn\'t easy but Mr. B is a very generous grader and just wants you to do your best. If someone with anxiety like me can pass this class with an A than anyone can. Take speech with Mr. B.;
Im TERRIFIED of public speaking and after this class i cannot say I am less so, but Mr.B is a caring prof who really wants you to do well! The comments saying to just try aren\'t wrong, he\'s an easy grader and I should have gotten a B cause of my exam scores but ended up with an A anyways? Also happened to a friend of mine. Just try and you\'ll pass.;
Really good professor. He cares about his students and always wants them to improve. He knows everyone fears of public speaking but he makes the class a friendly environment. Tests are easy. Never opened the purple book. I used the white one to help me with our speech outlines. Very kind. You have 6 free absence passes. If you go over, you fail.;
This is a great class to take for people with no previous experience. He will help you get through every speech. Tests are so easy, as long as you put in effort and show up, youll be fine;
Very approachable professor. Understands that public speaking can be nervous to many, so he isn\'t harsh when he gives criticism. His grading is easy to understand. Overall, practice your speeches ahead of time so that you\'ll be in a good spot. There are a few exams as well, so you do have to read some chapters if you want to do well on those.;
this prof is soooo boring. this course is basically an intro kind of course in journalism, but he treats students as if they\'re experienced reporters. this class also has TONS of readings & online quizzes on very random topics found in the NY times. everything is powerpount;
No Comments;
She is a great professor! She is pretty gracious, but does expect a lot from her students. I would take her again for Aural in a heartbeat!;
am really i took your class, what a blessing, he taught like an african teacher from Ghana. he will make u love chemistry. oh my God he doesnt run from questions. his in class lecture notes are the best. am done with the class but i have his lectures still in memory. i will take u again for pleasure just to be good with calculations. dont miss him;
Great professor! He is very passionate about chemistry and will explain it as many times as you need so you understand it! I would definitely take a course taught by him again! If you listen and try then you can easily get an A .;
great teacher. he is clear and he explains step by step. he is the best teacher ever. I love his class I hope he can teach my 1113. he covers the all book and I don\'t need to buy it. Mr. Tony the best teacher ever.;
HAHA did i say easy A, he never runs from a question. he encourages more questions. he simplifies all the material. his tests are written problem solving. but you\'ll get a question that wasn\'t discussed in class over 4 times. I know slow students who made it in his class so because he was willing to help;
One of the best professors I have ever had.;
Professor Tony Hage is an AMAZING instructor I strongly recommended him, very passionate, explains in detail, making complex info., easy to understand, shwd short cut, go above and beyond to help students, plenty of reviews & materials, available before & after class, 3exams, labs, & a final. Overall, an excellent professor! I would take him agai;
Toni Hage helps you understand Chemistry. He is there for you, if you want to learn. Tests are not multiple choice, so you must know your material. All the material is covered in the lectures.;
Her tests were imposible. The reading is rediculous. You have to memorize stuff that ultimatly means nothing.;
best chem professor for 150 easily. tests are harder than the other professors but she\'s such a good lecturer that it offsets it. she also provides the opportunity for a 5 point bonus each test that helps a lot. you have to work but she makes it worth it.;
Chem is difficult but doable. Use all resources: office hours, EPASS, Chem Mentors. Great lecturer. Kind person. Helpful at answering questions. Enthusiastic.;
I took McGill because I heard that she makes you understand concepts instead of just memorizing equations or facts, and I wanted to challenge myself. It\'s true;
She\'s amazing. Really helps you understand the concepts of general chemistry with a little bit of organic mixed in. She made me a chemistry major! Go to chem mentors and do the class worksheets and it\'s not hard to get an A.;
Even though we are slightly past midterms, I have thoroughly enjoyed his class. When I decided to take his class many people told me not to take it, but he is very personable. The best way to pass his class is to write down what\'s on the board and then refer back to the book to take more in depth notes. I will definitely be taking his class again.;
He is a nutcase but he\'s awesome. His courses are very interesting.;
He is an okay teacher. Take notes and study them. He tests from what notes he gives in class, unless your in Forensic Psych. He can be a jerk, so try to stay on his good side. Most people dont like him but as far as learning goes, hes it. He knows his field, sometimes he thinks he knows everything. But like I said, stay on his good side or he can m;
Dr. Snider is amazing. It\'s true his tests are very difficult and his lectures are in depth, but he makes you want to do well in his class. Very easy to get help outside of class and makes it worth your while to go talk to him. He is also great for lab!;
He is hilarious, but a tough grader. if you go to office hours he would be gladly to help. Overall just a great person to talk to.;
Snider is very caring and uses humor to keep your attention. He wants to help you but you need to ask! His tests are hard but as long as you study you will do fine;
I learned many things about health science from her class. Class discussion posts are confusing (hard to follow). She gives extra credits, so if you work hard you;
This class was interesting and an easy A. Really, Trish just wants you to show that you are involved in this class. She is a clear grader and her readings are all online. (saves you a textbook!) Her tests give you two chances to pass so that makes it really convenient.;
A pleasure to have this professor. Very precise, helpful and a great sense of humor. Would take her again;
Rohy is quirky for sure, but she is able to break down the most complicated material to anyone. Also, she encourages adventurous essay topics;
Definitely one of my favorite classes while I was at Vol State. She made the class very fun to learn in. She is very cool and was very understanding about me having a class at another school. You can\'t be shy or embarrassed in her class, because she\'ll use her psychology on you! But if you get the chance to take her, take her. She is really cool.;
Best professor ever happen to me :D She is nice, and give respectful feedback on every piece of homework you submit. She taught wonderful genetics, and she knows what she is talking about during class. She is also super helpful on projects. I\'d definitely recommend her to anyone.;
He is cool guy, interesting as well.;
the online class is very easy just answer the discussion questions and respond to others. Thats it . Easy A;
Took his class online very easy stay on top of the syllabus it tells you ahead what the work is only missed one discussion board but did well on everything else be sure to cite answers from the book and paper 5-7 pages cite from things you covered in the book easy A very clear on what he wants put in effort even half way you\'ll pass trust;
IT IS MIND-BLOWING HOW BRILLIANT THIS MAN IS. Knows so much about the world. Class is easy. Weekly quizzes (10 multiple choice) and a final project (either website or blog). The best professor at MHC and I don\'t even like politics!!! But this class was awesome!!;
MY FAVORITE PROFESSOR ON EARTH!!!;
Vinnie is the best professor I\'ve had by far. His lectures were the most interesting I\'ve ever sat in. You can tell he really cares about his job and it shows in his energy. The workload: no homework, 3-4 really easy mc quizzes, and two straightforward essays. Easy A if you go to lecture and actually listen and take notes.;
His lectures make no sense but you never have to show up to class. He only gives a midterm and final and as long as you get the review he gives out the class before youll do fine. He uses the same exact questions on the midterm and final as the review with different numbers. he leaves the room during the test and the class takes the test together;
He has a thick accent and gives a lot of homework. Class was very challenging;
His class is very fun! Took his hybrid class, so we met once a week. All the material was online on canvas. He gives a notetaking guide that correlates to each slide in his presentations and you can use that cheat sheet on the exams! You can also fill the margins with extra notes and it\'s okay. Loved his class :);
Professor Thielen is a good teacher and just a good person in general, his lectures are interesting and he cares about his students. There was a lot of reading and homework but I was in his hybrid class. Show up, do the homework and study for the tests and you\'ll do great.;
Professor Thielen is an amazing person. He gives good feed back and his presentations are very informative. You really only need the book to for a few questions on the tests that don\'t reference his slides. I took this class online and had a blast. If you need to take a communications class take this class with this professor. You won\'t regret it.;
The best professor at gsu;
teacher is sooooo odd. weirdest teacher ive ever had.. makes funny faces and reacts oddly to fire drills...kinda freaky actually. i would avoid.;
Tough class with a lot of material. Although much of it is dry, you will learn a lot, probably more than you should in a single 10 week class. Tests are straightforward and follow the reading she assigns.(which is a ton);
Do not buy the workbook. This class is an easy A. Students who don\'t pass are the ones who study the night before. If you can\'t get an A in this course, you are not ready for upper level science courses. also DO NOT BE LATE. NOT EVEN A SECOND (LITERALLY).;
Dr. Brooks is an amazing teacher. I had him for Biodiversity and I learn so much and his lectures were never boring. He actually teaches, yet you have to put on your part to do well in class.;
He\'s super intimidating at first and then you see he really tries to make the entire lecture time engaging. Don\'t be late, don\'t talk during his lecture, and TURN OFF ELECTRONICS (for real). Tests are fair, lots of pop quizzes so make sure you read topics ahead of time or you\'ll regret it, and he offers many extra credit opportunities.;
I had Dr. Brooks for BSC 1010 and 1011. He is very knowledgeable in what he teaches. On the exams, his word choices are very tricky. So when you\'re studying for the exams, make sure you are very certain in what you\'re studying otherwise the wording could potentially trick you. He gives unannounced quizzes so study before each lecture.;
I took Brooks for BSC1010 as well, same textbook that I never opened. Read the ppts! take notes on what he lectures! Go to classes and study for iclicker quizzes, they are pop quizzes & not scheduled. Exams often have a few freebies but they are very long, study well!;
In my opinion, this class was not difficult at all as long as you actually studied and prepared well for his iClicker quizzes. His test questions are very direct and fair. You don\'t need to buy his textbook, just his lecture book so that you can write notes in it. Yes he does have strict rules, but he\'s very funny and makes lectures entertaining.;
Personally loved this class, he\'s low key funny so it\'s not that boring. He tells you exactly whats on the test if you go to class. Don\'t buy or read the textbook buy his little brown book instead. Study his powerpoints and that book and the stuff he says in class and it\'s not that hard. If you don\'t pay attention in class might call you.;
The GOAT;
This is one of the best professors I have had at this school. His lectures are very straight forward and if you take good notes and study there is no reason you shouldn\'t pass. It is also an added bonus that he is extremely funny and really engages the class. His exams are fair and a lot of times he will hint at questions he will ask during lecture;
Very funny during lectures, keeps you engaged for the most part and makes everything easy to understand. Took him for both Bio Principles and Bio DIversity, and glad I did. GO TO THE LECTURES! Everything he says during lecture is fair game for the exams, which are a bit difficult, but if you pay attention and do what he asks you\'ll have no problem.;
i absolutly hated the class!! he was horrible! I can\'t believe that he can teach at all!!;
Gordon\'s class is super easy if you take the time to memorize the map quizzes. They are basically an easy grade. He also gives tons of extra credit and he gives 3 free questions on each exam. Definitely take this for an easy A.;
Great professor, super nice. He is the type of professor who cares more about student\'s learning than grade, and actually means it. He is a super caring guy and really wants to help students. He has many great life stories to share and will not fail you as long as you show up and be respectful, and try. Easy class, and teaches a lot!;
Nice guy, gives you study guides for exams, 7 map quizzes. If you actually study, you\'ll do well. Don\'t bother buying the book;
Very funny professor! 80% of his lecture is him telling stories. He gives out extra credit questions when attendance is low. Exams are really tricky! A lot of stuff is on them that was never covered in class. Also is slow to respond to emails, and to grade.;
Took online course. Day after Midterms I was the *only* one who turned in the next assignment. Rest of the year was 3 people turning in their homework. Took off points for incorrect COMMENTS, not just incorrect code. hyper-specific. bad teacher. wouldnt even help me install the software properly, gave no link to online instructions either.;
great professor.;
best prof in this univ;
Great professor, by far the best one I have had for an online class. About 4 essays throughout the class but makes it clear of what he expects. Gives feedback, even if it is just to say it was a good essay, which I believe means a lot.;
I am in psy 2315 now (spring 2016) and he has only five 200-word essays in 15 weeks, plus 14 short opinion questions. It is almost impossible not to get full credit. He does was want references in APA style and does not permit direct quotations. The tests are bit hard.;
I would take him again now that I understand his grading and standards. They aren\'t made clear in the syllabus so it took a while. Only two quizzes, but they are definitely challenging. Essays are hard to figure out at first, but there are 5-6 (200word), and a discussion every week. Overall, not a bad class, just depends on your preference.;
inspirational, caring;
Masten, while I\'m sure he\'s a great, harilous person outside of class, he\'s definately not that way in class. He is very unclear of this subject and reads straight from his Pearson PowerPoints. I will not take his class again because I learned absolutely nothing.;
William Masten is not a professor I\'d ever recommend. He\'s lectures are very scattered. The only benefit is that all the information you need to pass is in the Power Points and book. Don\'t expect to gain much from him personally.;
Biochem 2 isn\'t very difficult. The material isn\'t hard to grasp and understand (at least to me). If it is for you go to lecture: Saffran\'s explanations will make this child\'s play. What makes this course challenging is memorizing reactions. Put the time in and youll also have an A and still be able to recall almost all the reactions a year later.;
Professor Chung is one of my favorite finance professor. He knows his stuff inside out and very clear in explaining concepts with real world example. I don\'t know why others are saying his 106 is difficult compared to others. His exams are not multiple choice, but it\'s not easy to get an A. The best thing is he curves the class by a lot.;
Took two finance classes: BUS 106 and BUS 134 with Professor Chung. His midterms are fairly easy compared to final exam like most of the classes. He gives you study reviews before every exam and you are pretty much guaranteed B+ given that you studied all those. As long as you know his lectures, HW set A and study review, getting A is not difficult;
Wang Laoshi is an AMAZING Professor. She effectively uses her teaching experience to the fullest, presenting the material in clear way. She makes sure her students not only understand but retain the information she gives. Also, she shares details of the Chinese culture which help illuminate the lessons.;
3 tests & 3 quizzes. She teaches very fast, but as long as you go over your notes again you should be fine. I got an A on every quiz and test. You do not need the textbook. The example problems she gives during class are very similar to the ones on the tests and quizzes. You need her notes to do well, so go to class. Class is 500 points total.;
Applied math major here. def one of the best math profs I\'ve taken at CSULB. I would jump at any opportunity to take her again. Great professor and person.;
Love Dr. Kim Park she is very straight to the point. There are ABSOLUTELY NO SURPRISES in her class. Very nice grader too! Surprisingly a funny professor too you just have to catch her in the right moment! Doesn\'t use text. Homework is online. Very prompt grader I was worried about this class but she made it very basic and easy to understand!;
Only three quizzes and three tests. Homework is not collected. She goes over material fast but teaches clearly. Go to class. Gives a lot of extra credit. Take her if you are pre-nursing. One of the better Stats 108 professors. It\'s hard work, but an A is definitely attainable.;
She teaches very fast, but if you attend all of her lectures you will be fine. For her stat 108 class, there are 3 quizzes, 3 tests and then a final. Be sure to review your tests/quizzes to make sure they were graded correctly because her TA this year marked several things wrong that were not. Overall, she is very funny and tries to make it fun.;
She\'s a great professor. Pay attention if you haven\'t taken stats, but if you did then it\'s pretty much review. I suggest going to tutoring, and do the homework. It really helps with practice. Go to lectures, they\'re important. Tests are easy if you know what you\'re doing. I suggest her as a stats professor. No midterm, cheatsheet for final! Easy.;
About this class: turned out to be really interesting, although readings are long, they\'re interesting to read. Not a hard class, reasonable amount of work, do consider if you\'re in need of W credit. About Woody: It\'s easy to see how passionate she is. Although she is slow at explaining concepts, she is indeed knowledgeable. Her TA\'s are amazing;
Good teacher. No HW or quizzes, just exams. Exams were difficult but open book. If you show up to lecture every day and ask questions it shouldnt be too hard. Also his grading rubric is VERY generous;
He\'s certainly got little patience outside of class and isn\'t very accessible in general, but if you do the readings and come to class you can get by easily.;
I LOVED Lesk\'s sex in the city class- would highly recommend this first year seminar. The material and field trips were very interesting and Lesk clearly knew a lot about the subject matter and added a lot to the overall experience. Sometimes it was hard to tell what kind of mood he was in which was scary, but for the most part he\'s a fun prof.;
Really arrogant, and just annoying. Really easy to get a good grade even though he\'s nit-picky.;
Very fair at marking and is really really funny! His classes were the highlight of my semester, can\'t wait for PHY 1322!;
Best teacher in the department-perhaps the college. You get out of her classes what you put in. If you want to learn, you will. If you don\'t, you won\'t.Gives attention to all levels in the class. Whether an advanced dancer or beginner. Do not expect and easy A - expect to write and work hard.Put in the effort and the class is VERY rewarding andfun!;
Very fun but challenging class! If you\'re open minded, by the end of the semester you\'ll know how to tap. Gel is one of my favorite professors. She\'s hard, straight to the point, and a great teacher.;
He\'s a little difficult to understand, but I took this class at 8am. He focused more on computation than conceptual questions, but does a great job at explaining both.;
Key points: 1. Mostly Vectors and Vector applications. 2. All tests were easy for anyone with a clear understanding of Cal 2. 3. Final was extremely hard. 4. Magical Curves? I went into the final needing to make a 100 to make a solid B. I did terrible on the final. Ended with an A-. 5. Great Teacher. 6. Short Homework due every lecture.;
Super passive-aggressive. Asked her simple questions and gets confused. Tried to dumb the question down and ask again and she still was confused. Not surprised a lot of people dropped. Quizzes and boring documentaries every week. would not take again!;
Lectures are interesting, his tests are very straightforward, and the homework is minimal. Great professor and if you show up to class, pay attention, and read the textbook, his class should be a breeze. No surprises with him.;
Give grade with no rules. You will not understand were your lost the point. And he will gives low grade to who has controverisal to him. It\'s unfair. And you will not get time to make up your assignment if you missed homework, even you have any reaosn. Too much detailed things that you mighy missed. Be careful to choose.;
Dr. Bob is an amazing instructor! His lectures are beyond amazing and so enjoyable. I took both is Psych classes my first year at Highline and I absolutely do not regret anything. He\'s very organized too! Make sure to do those readings and study those before an exam! There are no secrets! Just read, memorize and study! DO THE 1 PT BONUSES!!!;
I\'m horrible at math. I had to take all of the development classes and barely passed those. Professor Young is the best math teacher I have ever had. Yes, I made an effort to learn the material but he really breaks down everything and never makes you feel stupid for not knowing/remembering a concept. TAKE HIM IF YOU STRUGGLE WITH ANY TYPE OF MATH;
Professor Young is amazing! I have always had a hard time with algebra, I made a C in pre algebra even! I dropped college algebra three times before finding professor Young. He speaks math to where I can actually understand it. Couldn\'t find a better math teacher!;
Hardest grader in the BYU English department AND you have to get a 95 to get an A. Basically means that getting an A is impossible (though A- is achievable for the work of an A+ in a different English class). Learned a ton, but worked a ton for it as well. Dont regret taking the class but probably wouldnt take again.;
One of the most enriching classes I have taken during my undergrad. Dr. Siegfried cares not only about her students but about their academic achievement and challenges you to become a better writer, thinker, and human. Her expectations are incredibly high and getting an A is a challenge, so get ready to read and write but the work is well worth it;
Professor Siegfried believes that her students are capable and intelligent, so she pushes your limits more than any professor I\'ve ever had. However, the work is worth it;
Very good teacher!;
I\'m not sure why he has a 3.5 when he deserves a 5.0. He\'s a wonderful professor and as long as you do the work .;
Lectures well, but has a tendency to go off on tangents and can come off condescending at times. He takes forever to grade assignments, and grades as if you\'re a professional. His instructions are fairly clear, but the course is rigorous, and if you don\'t have time to sit down and plan essays out you\'ll be lucky to get out with a B.;
Excellent teacher, very fun and knowledgeable about course material and give extremely fair tests for the midterm and final. I really cant say anything bad about him as a professor, if you get a chance to take classes with him you wont regret it.;
Dr. White has a very outspoken personality. If she sees you sleeping or daydreaming, she will call you out. However, she is an amazing teacher. Truly knows what she is talking about and really wants you to actually learn. If you enjoy PR, take her. I would recommend her to everyone.;
One of the most genuinely nice and caring ladies i\'ve ever met. Cares about the well-being of her students and how they are doing in the class. Yes, she is a difficult grader, but she makes you a MUCH better writer! Go to her office hours, show up to class, and turn things in on time and you should have no problem getting a high B or A.;
Dr. Chen is an excellent professor! She cares deeply about the success of her students and she is always willing to help. Pay attention during her lectures, take notes, and ask questions. She is the best professor I have had a Ball State.;
Most instruction takes place with videos and through practical applications. She is always quick to respond to questions and willing to help.;
She\'s deffinatly my favorite ISOM professor. She gets students engaged in class and connects with you one-on-one. Available for help and if you don\'t understand something, ask and she\'ll clear things up and bring it to a level thats relatable to you. You have to work for a good grade. Loved the class though.;
average teacher. would not take again, fair grader.;
AVOID. I was so excited to take a feminism class, she absolutely ruined it for me. Kept calling cisgender women \'born women\' and brushed me off when I brought it up. Class discussion felt forced and inorganic, readings were excessive and unnecessary. Mandatory participation is a major drawback since she absolutely doesn\'t care what you have to say.;
Dr. Cherry is a great professor. It\'s a discussion based classed with a relaxed atmosphere where people can share their ideas about the text. You need to read in order to do well, but he chooses good texts for the class. He has a great sense of humor, and is clear about what he expects you to accomplish in your papers. I recommend taking his class.;
Hes an overall great guy who\'s passion for films is evidently conveyed through he\'s lectures and comments. He has helped me become more critical in my analyzing of films and has created my love for French New wave cinema.;
I overall enjoyed Charles\'s class. However, he IS pretty disorganized at times. He does drone on often like people say but I really appreciate how passionate he is about what hes talking about. Hes flexible with late papers but hes also a tough grader!!! People complain about him being boring but hes a really nice professor and an invested guy.;
I took his Native American history class for credit and enjoyed it so much that I came back for US Hist. Dr. Boucher is an awesome teacher and I genuinely learned a lot from him;
I wish Prof. Dobson taught 226 because he would be my first choice. He is an amazing professor who knows what he is talking about. All of class is lecture but it is engaging and easy to follow along. Sometimes he talks super fast, but if you ask him to repeat something, he will do it right away and make sure you understand. I highly recommend him!;

Easy class, just take notes and you\'ll be fine. Tests are usually opinion questions mostly. Textbook not mandatory but it helps.;
TAKE MY WORD FOR IT. DO NOT TAKE HER. She is such a rude person, doesn\'t care about her students, doesn\'t thoroughly teach. If you don\'t understand something, too bad. When you ask questions, she will either laugh OR not even acknowledge you. I learned by asking OTHER STUDENTS, not the arrogant professor! Please don\'t take her! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE;
"Rambles a lot. He takes up half of the class going on his ""Midkiff diversions."" We\'re paying money to get an education, not listen to stories. His in-class examples are nothing like the test questions and the homework problems are unnecessarily hard. If you get above a 60, he counts them as a 100 because ""the program messes up."" The book sucks too.";
She is an amazing professor! Her lectures are clear, concise, and entertaining. You can tell she is genuinely excited about what she\'s teaching. She is also very smart. The readings are important in this class, as are the lectures which you don\'t want to miss.;
Stunningly beautiful;
Probably one of the hardest classes I\'ve taken so far. Had to fight to barely make an A. Only consists of quizzes and lab reports and both are 50% of final grade. Quizzes are super tough! Lab reports are easy if you go by the labmanual (required). Good professor but TA does most the work. Tough lab overall.. Get different professor if you can.;
Absolutely amazing professor! A wonderful person as well! Labs are very easy marks and his exams are extremely fair! :);
Be prepared for lots of readings and bad jokes. Brilliant guy, just has terrible lecturing skills and tends to devote whole class periods to unrelated or unhelpful material.;
he is a great professor and seems very cool;
Talham is a great guy, but thinks we are geniuses. He made the final very hard but because the average was pretty low, he changed the grade scale to help us out a bit, I had an 82 which was an A- in his class, so yes its hard but the scale makes up for it. I studied so hard for each exam but every exam was very difficult, and he covered more topics;
dont take this teacher...it\'s all powerpoint presentations and doesnt hold study sessions of any kind. Not very helpful and boring. Tells random stories.;
I learned a lot from him.;
"can\'t stand her--tells you her ultra liberal ideas are fact and if you try to argue and discuss like a normal classroom atmosphere, she gets extremely upset and tells u u are wrong and whoever told u that is wrong. today in class she said only white people can be **** and only males be ****. she also said that ""if bush were black he would hav";
This class is extremely straight forward. Dr. Perkins literally wrote the book for this class. This means do what he says, and you will make an A. Unfortunately, he asks a lot with homework assignments nearly every class. However, if you just put a little bit of time into the class throughout the semester, it will be one of your easiest classes.;
This Professor seems to think that students can, and should, read her mind. Trying to write a paper for her is like trying to hit an invisible target. Her directions are vague, yet her expectations when grading are very specific and annoyingly subjective. She is also unnecessarily loud, I\'ve made a habit of wearing earplugs to class.;
Crockett\'s the most hilarious professor I\'ve ever had, and he\'s retiring soon. Trust me, no matter what your major is you will NOT regret taking one of his classes.;
Definitely a course on the tougher side but I would take it again without thinking twice. The information is extremely interesting & his passion for it makes it so much better. You definitely need to set aside an hour a day to look over the information from the class before then you\'ll be golden. He is an amazing person and teacher don\'t miss out!;
Great sense of humor!!!! Love parasites now!!!!!;
Great guy. Makes a boring subject fun, and is probably one of the nicest professors on campus;
I really enjoyed Professor Harding\'s class. He\'s really funny and easy going. There are only 2 exams (midterm & final) from what I can remember and they\'re both take home. There is one presentation but it is with a partner and its super easy. He has one short paper 3-4 pages and one long paper 5-7 pages. This is an easy class to get a WI credit.;
She made it easy to give speeches in class. Loved how she made us do warmups on speech day.;
I could tell she loves her subject but she is a bit scattered and that makes it hard to learn from her. I enjoyed being in this class because of the classroom discussion but her lack of preparation is hard to learn anything from her. So if you take her GET THE BOOK!!!! READ THE BOOK!!!!! Do those 2 things and you will be fine.;
She opens your eyes to Asian American women issues, but make sure to do your outlines asap! There is few hw and barely any quizzes, so try to work hard on them. Midterm and final were essays, she\'s a tough grader but you just need to understand and write in her pov. Visit her during office hours and sit in different parts of the classroom, trust me;
Take this class if you\'re genuinely passionate about Asian American history. A lot of the people that didn\'t like her, weren\'t really interested in the content. She\'s very vague when it comes to assignments. There\'s a midterm, a final, and some outside work. But as long as you put that you deserve an A on the self evaluations, you\'ll get an A.;
truthfully I took classes in DMIT expecting to receive a scholarly perspective, I dont think he even has a degree;
FINA 405 with him is considered a CAPSTONE FINA course. You\'ll be solving cases and presenting throughout the semester. It\'s extremely useful for finance students looking to apply what they have learned. It\'s a very demanding course but you\'ll be ready for the workforce thereafter. He used to manage a multi billion hedge fund. The best prof w/ expe;
Taking this class was a negative experience. the grading seemed very random, with little feedback and no clear criteria. Instructions for the midterm were unclear. Help for the project was very vague, with most of the valuation skills learned online... no one failed the course, but there were very few As and no one knows why they got their grade;
Dr. Branch was a difficult teacher to work with. Although she was helpful when it came to projects, the answers were usually vague and not direct. When grading, I felt as if she graded based off of personal opinion rather than the facts that were clearly on the paper. Helps you to become a good writer but not a great one.;
Slow to respond online, could have been due to small class size so less priority, but still..;
really cool teacher. she is very passionate about the subject and her class is somewhat enjoyable. her grading is difficult but if you put time into it she will give you a good grade;

Professor Borgwardt is one of those professors that gives hope to the world of academia by ensuring future academics are mentored well. Her lectures and discussions are fascinating and she is attentive to students\' and their interests outside of class. Her office hours are frequent. Her insight is incredibly valuable, and she is genuinely kind.;
Just be sure to pay attention and actually study for the tests & the class will be pretty easy. Don\'t fret over the 10 page essays because you\'ll get a good grade as long as you include all that she asks for in the rubric. Nothing too difficult. She\'s a great professor, knowledgeable, very nice, & pretty funny.;
Professor Spievak is super knowledgeable and Cognitive Psych is SO interesting. This class is definitely not for you if you dont enjoy reading articles, writing essays, or taking lecture notes without a PowerPoint. I personally did really well and liked her a lot as a person. Would take a class with her again!;
Depends on her students way to much. If no one responds when she asks the class a question expect a long awkward silence. She does however make her lectures clear and is always there for you if you seek help in her class;
The professor is very friendly and loves to give to give students life lessons. The class can be boring at times boring because he loves to bounce around topics (anatomy to life). As for the exams, quizzes, and labs, they are very easy. Best advice, memorize everything and beware of falling behind in anatomy... otherwise it will bite you in da ass!;
3D explanations are not her thing but over all easy class. If you do the assignements properly, easy A because her final is basicly questions from the book;
No Comments;
Dr. Dogru always had well planned out packets to give us. However, we basically had to learn the material in groups before she would teach us how to do it. She was very sweet and was always available for office hours. She didn\'t put homework grades in until the end so I thought I was getting a C when I really ended up with an A-.;
great teacher great class great time!!!!!!!;
He\'s such a passionate professor and I loved taking his class. It\'s clear that he loves his area of expertise and enjoys teaching people about the Holocaust. The books and readings assigned are very interesting and most often a pretty easy read. I LOVED THIS PROFESSOR;
Prof. Williams, ahh, what a man! A truly unique individual in that you would never know what random thought would pop out during class. Sometimes difficult to discern what material was being covered in class and his explainations were sometimes as clear as mud . . . not always helpful during office hours, but at least he would try to help.;
TOOK THE 6 WEEK WINTER CLASS AND IT WAS FAIRLY EASY. HE\'S VERY AVAILABLE TO HELP WITH QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS. GREAT CLASS.;
Man, this teacher is what all teachers should be!!! If you have a class that he teaches, you should soooooo take him! He\'s wonderful!;
Easy class, scattered professor but effective. Miss a few weeks & you will suffer in the class. Miss once & you are ok. Quizzez & fill in the blank tests are covered in the class, so you know exactly what he wants to see... Just show up, take decent notes & its a pretty easy A;
Easy class. Knowing the cases that will be covered before had really pays off. Know his examples. They will be on tests. He throws no curves, and is concerned with his students. Excellent way to brush up/get hours for the CPA exam.;
I truly recommend taking this class. I have never learned so much!! Her classes are very difficult, but definitely manageable. Her lectures are interesting and funny, and she is also very understanding.;
Highly intelligent and interesting professor. Be professional and participate as well as willing to learned something. Their is no right or wrong answer, so be involve and have fun doing it. The class will only be as hard as you make it. I will definitely take his class again. Honestly enjoyed every moment while able to take with me some knowledge.;
Did not enjoy the lectures, they were clear but I feel that he spent too much time on every idea thus we ran out of time occasionally and it could get boring. He can call on students at random so be aware of being put on the spot. Instructions for our essay were very open-ended and this made it much more difficult. He is a nice guy though for sure!;
Prof. Spears is by far the BEST professor/instructor/teacher I have had in my entire University experience. He was always so excited to start the lecture and actually cares about what he is teaching students. I\'ve taken two classes with him already and plan on taking any more that I can in my last year. Highly recommend taking any class he teaches;
Spears is amazing. Super passionate about what he does and encourages each pupil to have their own opinion. Really values your participation in class and likes to show you ALL perspectives in order to equip you for the actual world where there is no one answer to anything. Absolute favourite prof at UofG.;
Very interesting class! Very well done with some fun humor thrown in. If you love to read and can read fast, this is certainly a class you\'ll enjoy. Even if you can\'t get to the reading on a particular week, sparknotes and whatever else will suffice. Very fun!;
Great teacher.;
Ida... you can tell she is an amazing nurse and an even better woman. You can tell outside of class she is very nice... but in class is different. During exams she puts tissues in your face, takes your jacket, and once made me move my arm because I guess I could be cheating??? The class is hard, dont get me wrong, but it is definitely doable. STUDY;
Goes on pointless tangents a lot - tends to talk about himself more than about what we should actually be learning. Read the textbook if you want to pass, grades fairly but you need to put work into it in order to pass.;
Olay is a professor that makes you work for the grade you want. There are 3/4 presentations and the last one is a group presentation. He grades outlines hard. As long as you come to class you\'ll pass. Textbook is only used for exam and final.;
Worley rocks!! He\'s an awesome proffessor, and an awesome director. I loved being in his classes;
Good teacher, I took this as a second block class on accident. Lots of reading in the class, not super necessary for the lectures. But a fun teacher who\'s excited to share English with students, normal amount of homework assignments and a small 5 page paper due at finals. 8/10;
He\'s awful, impatient and not helpful.;
No Comments;
Shes an awesome teacher, her work is difficult but she knows what she is talking about. If you listen and do the work,you will learn a lot.;
Tough class. He seems to struggle to help the students who know nothing about coding, but is willing to do what it takes to help. Lots of projects which he doesn\'t go much over beforehand, and he expects you to try it on your own first.;
Hard tests but makes class fun...cool teacher!;
Dr. Burns is the best professor I\'ve had at Texas Tech. He is very tough on you but once you graduate and you are in the real world, you will realize his class is of vital importance. His plethora of experiences (worked on Saturn V !!), professionalism, and knowledge of IT project management are all used in today\'s IT world.;
The class is a handful of small lab reports that can be graded tough, lab notebook checks, and participation. The participation grade can save you. He is very sweet, wants to help, and is very considerate. He is incredibly intelligent so sometimes his lectures are over student\'s heads.;
Prof. Walker is the best professor I\'ve had here at IU. He\'s always willing to help you understand the material, and is committed to student success. Grades tests and returns them within 24 hours. While this class requires good calculus knowledge, he makes all the calculus applications super accessible. I would love to take this course again!;
He is a nice guy, but should not be teaching game design classes. He gives horrible advice that drove our project into the ground. He doesn\'t understand games at all. If you take any of the senior capstone classes with him, it would probably be in your favor to ignore what he advises you change about your game, which is to say everything.;
Outstanding prof. The very best.;
Chirico is unorganized and hard to follow.;
I worked hard but learned a lot.. Hes a very nice man.;
Professor Baer is a great teacher! He enjoys lectures and tends to mumble or speak fast, but always makes sure that you understand before moving on. He enjoys teamwork and has teams work for points. Tests are all multiple choice, but they are not super easy. You definitely need to review notes before tests. I would absolutely take him again!;
This class is more of an informative class for your future in the aerospace program while learning about basic fundamentals. Dr. Baker cares a lot about everyone in the department and tries to assure everyone is set up for success in this class and in their future in the AEM curriculum.;
Beneski is a little monotone, but if you pay attention he\'s very good at explaining and the class can be easy. Don\'t skip class. He has powerpoints online, but he goes into much more detail during class. He\'ll say something once, and it might pop up on a test. Take good notes. Overall, he\'s a good teacher.;
Dr. Beneski has a pretty monotoned voice but he knows his stuff. His lectures are dry and can be ridiculously boring but going is essential and worth it. It is a hard course but it is totally doable. Flash cards will be your lifesaver.;
Very comfortable pace for a Calc class. He goes over several examples for each topic and leaves time at the end of class for questions. Very easy to reach to meet during office hours. If you\'re trying to get into the school of business but struggle with Calc, he\'s the perfect teacher.;
LOVE LOVE LOVE best prof at middlesex county college. Hated history before i took him. Attend class and participate and you will get an A;
Dr. Gallaher is a fantastic teacher and truly cares about the success of his students. He gives amazing examples and uses many anecdotes in class in order to help students understand the material. He is most definitely the best English teacher I\'ve met in my collegiate career and I\'m glad I had a chance to take Comp. 2 with him.;
Not going to lie. How I passed this class is literally going to class a week before a midterm to get the questions and then, I googled the stuff before class on my drive to the university. When I did attend class, the lectures were long and never on topic. The TAs were no help either as they were too busy with their own studies to help.;
Bio 475 is really not a difficult class. There are a few tests, but all the questions are given beforehand and discussed in class. The semester ends with a debate, which is pretty fun. My only advice and warning would be to FOCUS ON THE PAPER. You choose your topic after the first week, so just keep up with it.;
Fisher was the funniest biology professor I\'ve had. If you payed attention during lecture and read the chapters, the class was easy. Would take him second semester if I could.;
She is a great teacher who makes everything clear. She\'ll help you when you need it.;
Good instructor, she\'s hilarious and has a passion for English that most people don\'t have. Participate in the discussions, come up with original ideas, and you\'ll be fine. Lots of reading (it is a Lit course) and two-page papers due every week. Participation is a huge part of the grade, introverts beware.;
Professor Carr is one of the best professors I have had thus far. She is extremely open minded and loves to hear your opinion regardless of her agreeing with it. As for people complaining about the amount of books and reading, you can get her books cheaply online, and don\'t complain about reading when you are in a literature class. That is silly!;
She uses a point system that confused most of the students. We had quizzes everyday over the chapters. Tests weren\'t too hard but she did provide one extra credit assignment.;
Took this class online. Very straight forward. At the end of each week four chapter tests were due along with four separate responses to each chapter. She allowed for the test to be taken twice keeping the highest of the two grades. The final exam could only be taken once. Commit to reading the book. She has no problem answering questions.;
There is 5 books to read in this class, and every single class period you have a quiz. the quizes are 65% of your grade so if you are not willing to do the readings DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS THEN. she is nice and respected but can be rude when people are rude. we only have one paper to do in that class and for the final you had to come finals week.;
I highly recommend this professor! She is intelligent and cares about her students very much. I loved her class the most out of all of my political science courses so far. Be prepared to read everything though, and to work for your grade. The tests aren\'t too bad if you read all of the material and keep up with your assignments.;
Very sweet and funny lady. I would recommend her to anyone, but you have to pay attention. At all times. You have to read the study guide to support answers on assignments. Test are hard if you do not study, so study with all your life. Like. Everyday.;
A wonderful professor! She provides a clear outline of the course, and sticks to it! There are in-class readings and discussions for participation points. No exams, BUT a few pop quizzes - just read what she says to read! Research paper is 30% of your grade, but she lets you submit 2 drafts and she is there every step of the way if you need her!;
One of the most knowledgeable professors I have ever had. Tests are very difficult, but you can study for them. Write down EVERYTHING she says because you will see it again. Don\'t miss a class because you will miss a lot of material. If you work hard you will do well.;
Ruhi can be intimidating when it comes to asking questions in class. It seems like he gets frustrated for you needing clarification. This class would have been a lot harder if I had not taken AP Stats in high school. Although, the examples he gives in class give a good insight to the tests. He always gives a formula sheet, too.;
Boring lectures, doesn\'t allow technology in lecture or discussion, offers random extra credit quizzes about four times during the semester for up to 12 points so it\'s worth going to lecture. The slides are online but they definitely do not have all the information you need to know.;
If you just go to the lecture, take very good notes, and do the study guide, you will pass. His lectures are clear and understandable. He gives current examples to allow the student to understand the topic at hand. Homework, quizzes, and in class work are given. Tests are mainly multiple choice but problem sets are also included.;
Absolutely amazing. Take him if you can. His class is mostly online & meets about once a week. During class he more so gives life lessons & speaks from experience. He doesn\'t want anyone to fail. I\'ve never had a prof who cares so much about their student\'s well-being. 3 online tests, online final, weekly discussions, & a few papers, that\'s it!;
He was a really good teacher, it could get boring but he let us out early alot and if you do all your work you should do fine.;
Dr. Sumner is the most worthless professor I\'ve ever had. He never replies to emails, just gossips during class and doesn\'t help when requested. I honestly don\'t know how he\'s been teaching as long as he has.;
Passionate guy, loves teaching Spanish, has been at the burg for three decades. As long as you put in the work he will be there to help you do well;
Fantastic professor. Loved his teaching. Took documentary survey from him. He opened my eyes to the art of docs, which I didn\'t understand before the class. He makes you write, so be prepared for probably 3-5 decent length papers. He will grade semi-tough but it\'s worth it. Some of the docs aren\'t the most interesting, but are valuable nonetheless.;
Great lectures and articulates the concepts very well. Course materials are very well organized. He provides slides that are fill-in-the-blank so you pay attention, and it\'s not hard to with this teacher. He also records his lectures along with the slides which is a big bonus.;
Klaas is a great prof. I highly recommend if you have to take SSH105, make sure he\'s your prof! You can tell he really cares about his students, I have nothing but respect for the guy. Make sure you attend lectures and do textbook exercises (EMPHASIS ON TEXTBOOK EXERCISES). He\'s a pretty fair marker and will let you know exactly what he wants.;
Klaas was a great prof. Critical Thinking is an incredibly boring and slow course, but you could tell he was passionate about it and really knew the material well (I\'m pretty sure he played a role in writing the curriculum?) He posts the audio and powerpoint slides for every lecture on d2l, so you don\'t have to go to class. Overall a great class;
The lectures were clear, concise, and they made sense. Prof. Kraay was well spoken and always knew what he was talking about. He could answer any question the students asked him about the material.;
This class probably gave me the most anxiety. I was literally shaking before each evaluation. This class is composed of 4 quizzes. Final is 35%. Prof Kraay is definitely one of the best profs at Ryerson. My anxiety probably had to do with the fact that I was a 1st year student at that time but it also did not help having the lecture Friday evenings;
Best teacher ever.;
I had some health issues this semesters and she was very caring and willing to help. Class was a little boring, it\'s mostly just grading your grammar worksheets together, I almost wish it had been a little bit more challenging. Careful though, she was a much tougher grader than I expected for the big projects.;
Linda is a fantastic English teacher. She explains things clearly and openly. She will be the first to tell you that the assignment is odd or might not seem worth while, but she explains the why behind it. She is open and honest when she gives feedback, and really gives you keys to succeed.;
Professor Shelton was by far the best English professor I have ever had. She works with each student personally in order for them to be as successful as possible. She also has you work on one subject all semester long so all of the work you do is helping you develop your final paper. She is super compassionate and loving to all!;
Professor Shelton was one of the best professors I have had. She is always there for you when you need help during office hours, after class, and she is invested in student\'s success.;
She is literally THE BEST. She wants her students to succeed and wants you to get the best grade possible in her class. She does one on one conferences when it comes to midterms and your final paper. And she doesn\'t do a finals test! Your last research paper is your final and you finish the class a week early! Definitely has been my favorite.;
Sort of a tough grader but she makes her expectations very clear and gives a lot of good feedback;
One of the worst professors at the University of Alabama. The only reason people take his class is because it is required for the GIS certificate. He cares very little about you and the class. It is a shame that he has been allowed to get this far at the University of Alabama. The class is just power points and you have to teach yourself.;
Head of history department. As with almost any elective at Bentley, he takes the classes too seriously and the tests are graded toughly. That being said he does give you the list of terms and essay topics for the midterm and final a week in advance, so that helps. Overall meh, wouldn\'t take again but a super nice guy who cares a lot.;
Mrs. Mitchell is definitely the best teacher I ever had. She is caring, motivational, and wants you to succeed. She is brilliant and gives amazing lectures. She can be a tough grader but clearly states what she is looking for. Be sure to participate in discussions, she loves that. MAM will not only teach you theatre, she will teach you life lessons;
Great professor! Must rent textbook to receive participation points on the online discussions b/c participation grade weighs a lot. She likes to know you are reading the assignments and quoting from the actual book. She does offer extra credit via essay. Only need to write 2 essays for online class APA style. Great at replying back to emails;
One of the best classes I\'ve taken. I took this class online over the summer. There are weekly forum posts and quizzes. One final and two papers. She is easy to talk to and is always willing to help. There was a lot of reading, but it was easy reading cause it is all very interesting. Take her! You won\'t regret it.;
Took this class online and it was an easy A. If anyone isn\'t a Psych major and wishes to just knock this class out of the way i would recommend taking online. It saved me alot of time. All you need to do is reply to these forums once a week and you had 3 papers due throughout the whole semester and they were easy! She responds fast to emails.;
I loved Dr. Grabe\'s telecom class. She really knows all of her stuff and I found her lectures interesting and at times very enjoyable. She uses a lot of examples and often asks for people to participate and I often felt bad because hardly anyone beyond the same few would participate. She\'s really cheerful and has a great sense of humor!;
One of the finest profs Brock has - not an easy prof but passionate, committed and dedicated. You will learn so much from this woman. I would take another course from her in a heartbeat.;
Most attentive get right back to you right away clear honest and smart teacher online I have ever had! grades weekly. Sense of humor and cares about how you do. You do have to read the work and do research.;
Professor Saunders, is very clear on what you should expect for a lit class. If you have questions ask her, If you don\'t understand why you got a certain grade, she will answer it, and give decent to good feed back. Also, make sure you do the work, PARTICIPATE at least three times on the discussion board, and she is very FAIR with grades as well.;
Dr. Damen is amazingly helpful, and by far one of my favorite Professors. The content of the class was brutal, but he has a way of making it tolerable. He\'s incredibly motivating, and his comedy is stress relieving.;
He\'s really funny if your class is well behaved. He really likes teaching. It\'s not a super fun class, but he makes it fun.;
Boring lectures, makes you work too hard for the grade, taught an under-grad level course for grad students, exams are too lengthy designed not check your knowledge;
Great teacher. Kind of rude at points, but you will definitely know Chemistry by the end. He is hard but fair and makes you work for your grade. You don\'t get formula sheets for the test, but with enough practice they\'re fairly easy to remember. Take this guy if you can!;
"Very disorganized. Will waste your time, for sure, with odd musings and unrelated tangents. Makes it very clear how little she knows. Often behind on material. Uses the lab time to make up lecture time. Doesn\'t give the ""big picture,"" so you will have to teach yourself the material. On the upside, the exams are pretty easy if you use study guide";
I really loved Professor Phillips. I genuinely enjoyed attending her class each week. There were sometimes when the assignments were a bit confusing, but she was extremely lenient with due dates when she knew that we were confused. She always e-mailed back very fast and was always very willing to meet up whenever needed. She is also super nice!;
Prof Phillips is a great teacher. Definitely one of my favorites at TCC. She really cares. I learned a lot. But, I had to work hard! Tests are fair, usually there is a practice test. Start your semester project early! I loved this class and wish she taught other classes.;
eh it was ok;
There\'s not much lecturing, mostly group-work, and a lot of self teaching. A lot of people don\'t like the way it\'s set up, but I don\'t mind it. Teaching this way forces students to actually LEARN the material, and it makes the final a lot easier. The class isn\'t easy, but it\'s not really supposed to be. Get to know the people in your group!!;
"This is the most frustrating class I have ever taken. He literally does not teach. He gives you ""chemactivities"", and you are supposed to learn from your fellow students. The only plus is you get multiple chances to get the correct answer on tests(it\'s on a computer). I would not recommend him at all.";
Dr. Neal is a very hard, very nice teacher. He is also one of my favorite people alive. He is dedicated to the students and cares about them to the fullest;
I have taken three classes from professor Murphy-Lee at UW-Milwaukee and absolutely love her! As long as you attend class and do the readings this class will be easy peasy! She literally goes over word for word the answers you will need to write your papers and take your exams. She will help you endlessly so long as you ask. Definitely recommend!;
Unrealistic!! Avoid him!! He is so struck on himself that he does not lecture on important material. He likes hearing himself talk. He is interesting but a joke too.;
Hard class if you want to pass gotta do all the work!;
Professor Bltiz is a great professor. He really makes class interesting and great. He does have quizzes which I found kind of ridiculous as they were a bit tough. But make sure you do all his readings and homework and you will pass the class and his quizes. Also participate and actually try! Its all worth it.;
Test was pretty easy.Go everyday bc he takes attendance randomly and gives you extra credit. The class before the test he gives you a review..write these things down, they\'re pretty much word for word from the exam.For the paper, go to him and get your article cleared in advance and you will be ok;
Easy A, the difficult part is willing yourself to go to class. Interesting topics but he makes it boring. The papers are challenging as it is impossible to write a perfect paper in 2 pages double spaced while cramming in 8+ studies. They need to be longer, which I cant believe I would want. I would not take him again as I found it hard not to skip.;
Just a great, great guy. Makes an impossible class extremely bearable and not too difficult, all whilst making sure you learn the basic concepts of fluid mechanics. Hilarious, helpful, and just a great professor all around;
The accent is the worst part, he\'s very hard to understand. But the class overall is easy to pass with little effort. Attendance isn\'t mandatory but homework is due every class. He reviews the class before the test and it\'s a great indication of what to expect on the tests. His tests are multiple choice and easy to do well on. Textbook used for HW;
Awesome professor, he made Micro interesting. Such a genuine and funny guy, he really cares about his students and does a great job portraying the material. All of his lectures are online which helps with exams so much. Would 100% take him again if my major required me to. Great dad jokes.;
Great professor. You need to study and show up to class, but if you study his powerpoint slides, you will do well on the exams. He makes lecture fun and he jokes around a lot. One of the best teachers at MCPHS and he genuinely wants you to do well. He gives some easy, fun questions on exams sometimes for extra points. I would take him again!;
If you go to class and follow along and do tune up exam problems you should be totally fine. Final can be brutal because it\'s not like the tune ups but with the easy tune ups you\'ll already have a high average to cushion for the final.;
She is so off the wall and hard to follow. Entire grade is based off of 3 exams, masteringphysics and one final. That\'s IT. Her exams are all multiple choice and super specific to how she teaches. If you dont write down exactly how to do her problems, good luck.;
Great professor! His notes are very clear and organized. If you study and understand the notes, you will be perfectly fine! He gives lots of examples and is super interesting. He makes biology fun and helped me want to learn. He wont give your grade away.\'you have to earn it, but he is fair! Take him! He\'s always available for help and he cares!;
-take notes (for a grade) -read assigned chapters & HW -test are over lecture & readings -EXTRA CREDIT & DOES NOT LET YOU FAIL -AMAZING at help -a semester research paper, ( 5 pgs.) BUT if you ask her for help, visit, her office, & see\'s you\'re working ;
Writing notes important to pass She takes notebooks for a grade. Will not let you use laptop in class Txtbk only available online (McGraw-Hill) Complete Learnsmart sections on McGraw-Hill almost every week for hmwk Online quiz every week (15 min. for 20 questions) Nice & helpful. Some classmates are offended when she has to cover religion/Puritans.;
This was probably the worst experience I have ever had. If you are a female, forget it. If you correct him when he is wrong, forget it. He thinks he can grade you at the end of the semester by just what he thinks. My A was brought down to an A- because of it.;
Dr. Pecorino is honestly a great professor. His lectures are somewhat boring, but it\'s economics. The grading system is incredibly fair and Dr. Pecorino offers VERY generous extra credit. If you show up to every class he will give you 4 points on your final grade. You can get an easy A by just showing up to class and studying for exams.;
Dr. Pecorino is incredibly smart - there\'s no denying that. However, often times he forgets that he is teaching college students. do the study guides and you\'ll be fine for the tests. Go to lecture and MAKE him explain. The final however was awful. I scored above a 90 on every test and barely got a 68 on the CUMULATIVE final (35% of your grade).;
Not a bad choice for EC 110. He has dry humor. I made an A- in his class and studied a day or two before the test. I\'m not very smart either.;
Fine at best. He is disgustingly arrogant. However, if you can get past his ego he is more concerned that you understand statistics overall opposed to just the math behind it, which is good. Some days he can be very boring. Tests are fair and papers (yes papers, quite a few of them) are not terrible at all. Overall not terrible but not enjoyable.;
Great guy, conveyed a lot of passion about the subject, and gave a great intro to statistics. He really understands what he is teaching and to whom, and the class is well structured, even though there was some confusion about the textbooks/DVDs. He was also very democratic as to grading exams, removing confusing questions post-exam.;
The lectures were actually pointless for this class. MAKE SURE YOU READ THE TEXTBOOK!!! I learned all the stats I know from the textbook not him.;
Dr. Tandy is a sweet lady. This will not safe you however when it comes to passing this class if you don\'t work for it. Tests are very tough and there is really no time to study since the semester is full of incredibly long HWs, assignments, SUA, outside of class events and activities. Study early and get ready for tests a long time in advance.;
Took ACC 202 online and was skeptical at first because of the other reviews. She\'s a great professor and emails right away if you have questions. Read the book, do the practice questions, and double check your calculations, it helps. I got an A on all the exams, but you have to really think outside the box on some questions and manage your time.;
Great professor! Be prepared to do the work but the work is easy if you apply yourself. Deadlines matter but he gives enough time to complete it. Assignments are based on current events so it easily keeps interest!;
Great teacher. Not for the faint of heart, he can be abrasively constructive in his criticism. We wrote briefly every class. As long as you put forth effort he was willing to help. Pretty funny guy and his assignments are straight forward no bull. I\'m sure he hates me for my Nuclear Fission paper but TOO BAD. I hope he sees I said that too.;
I took him for a hybrid class and at first I honestly thought that I was going to regret it because he seemed tough. After the first few assignments and in class lectures, I was really liking the class and him as a professor. He is a super cool guy. He loves to focus on music and artists that he likes. The topic papers are different and interesting;
He is a really great teacher and if you put effort into the class you will do well.;
He knows the material;
Midterm was extremely hard. Doesn\'t clarify what you need to be studying at all.;
toooooo much damn work;
A great lecturer, passionate with what he\'s teaching. Really funny.;
Amazing teacher overall, there\'s 6 required assignments throughout the semester. Three in class essays and three home research papers. Overall he was an outstanding teacher, would definitely recommend.;
Hes really funny in a weird type of way if you take him you\'ll see. The work isn\'t all that difficult and he is really lenient with when you turn it in as long as you email him explaining why you couldn\'t on the due date. Definitely going to try to take him for 1102. Shows a lot of videos and you pretty much just write responses to them;
Professor Allen is very inspirational, if you like to write you will like them. He makes class entretaining and is very caring.;
Dr. Donahoe is very passionate about her work, which makes the class so much better. The homework assignments are through pearson, so they can be kind of difficult. The quizzes are online, but pretty easy. There are 3 tests and a final, not cumulative, and she drops the lowest score of each category. The only thing I didn\'t like were the labs.;
Such an amazing professor. Related everything to the real world, and really engages his students with his humor and animated way of lecturing. He always makes sure everyone understands each lesson & will go over everything as many times as needed to help you. Take good notes and review for quizzes and you will do great!;
This is the second class I\'ve taken with Dr. P, and she never disappoints. For someone who is enormously busy and hugely respected in her field, Dr. P always comes prepared to class, always has excellent feedback and knowledge to impart, and always makes class engaging. If you do the reading (there\'s a lot), you\'ll learn so much. Highly recommend.;
Medical Literacy was amazing! It got me excited about diverse medical fields. Ramin didn\'t lecture himself but behind the scenes, organized group of practicing physicians from Weill Cornell medicine. Every session was a case study and explored a field. The session on lung cancer made me quit smoking. So this class extended my life span by 10 years!;
BEST PROFESSOR EVER! she genuinely cares about giving you an education instead of just helping you simply pass the class. She is funny when necessary and is all around such a great human being. If you respect her and listen to her lectures and do your work you will pass. Definitely will take this class again 100x over;
If you want to be treated as child this professor is the one for you. Participation is mandatory and you will be call by name and ask to go to the board and solve problems in front of the entire class (it reminded me of elementary school) Do yourself a favor and take a class with a different professor.;
Ray is awesome. Very understanding..;
Dr. Bodek is seriously one of the best professors at CofC. His lectures are amazing and his class was very clear cut. He can acknowledge when he\'s assigned too much work and doesn\'t mind moving assignments around to better fit the classes needs. I would take him for anything he offers.;
Awesome professor;
He was AMAZINGGGGGGGG;
I took Professor Burns for Calc II. This professor really knows his stuff. He is very funny and is willing to explain to you until you understands the material. He give practice test before exam and it goes over. if you study the practice test you will pass the exam. Recorded his lecture, posted on YouTube any time you could access and review.;
Prof Curtis is so funny! His class is very much laid back but be prepared to do a paper every week the paper topics are not hard or lengthy (500 words) just make sure you do them. No exams and he is active in his field and encourages his students to join him in research.;
Hillarious and insightful, a real treat to hear talk, but you need to put in some effort to do well;
One of the best professors I have ever had, the best I have had at PLU so far. Great learning experience always engaging class sessions with fun content and awesome guest speakers. Really helped me do well in class obviously he cares for his students, even wrote a recommendation for me. Would highly recommend taking any of his courses.;
One of the best profs at PLU. I graduated 6 years ago and looking back he is still my favorite.;
He grades really weird but there is enough opportunity for extra credit.;
I recommend that you read the course description because the title of the course is misleading. The books for the class are necessary. Every assignment is based on the readings. He can come off as a little rude to the skeptics. However he really tries hard to be respectful. Be prepared to hear rambling from the die hard Christians in the class.;
Mailing it in. An Abomination.;
Dr. Stecker\'s class is really hard to pay attention to because he talks very quietly and is not very engaging. He also grades pretty tough too, but its not a bad class.;
Love this professor! Always willing to help and very easy to understand, you\'ll definitely enjoy his class and learn a lot. Very little homework. Would take another class with him in a heartbeat!;
Professor Stecker is probably the cutest and sweetest professor at CMU. He always cracks jokes and though you can\'t read his handwriting, he tries his best. He assigns readings, but usually hands out kind of confusing notes that go along with the readings. The quizzes & essays are directly from the notes he gives you. Overall a great guy!!;
what a guy.;
There are 5 essays you have to do throughout the semester. A few grammar tests. Classes finish early (woohoo!) She helps a lot during the process of writing the essay - just make sure you use her help in editing your drafts and what not. Not a tough grader, but you need to submit all essays. Grading is also very clear;
There are three essays and final is a presentation. Attendance is not mandatory. Professor Reynolds is pretty easy in grading. All readings are in the textbook.;
I can say very honestly that I learned nothing. He actually discussed what a cowboy is, what a cowgirl is, the fact that young woman love horses and really anything but geography. He was very scatter brained, unorganized and unclear. Three eight hour long field trips, so this should be more like a six credit course. Do not take his classes!;
Dr. Ryan is an amazing creative storyteller and is renowned in the multimedia community for his skills and expertise. During my time with him, we had many influential people come in as guest lecturers including the Creative Director for Coca-Cola, Design Moguls and renowned faculty. Get to know him, stay after class and participate. It will help;
super hard class but she was a great prof;
Definitely take physics from him, he actually cares about the students and does everything he can to make sure you learn. He also cares about your grade so he doesn\'t punish you for not knowing how to do everything and gives you several chances to learn. The tests aren\'t hard just study and do the homework and you\'ll get a good grade;
Dr. Bergeson is the best professor I\'ve ever had. He\'s goofy and eccentric and keeps his lectures entertaining, and somehow learned almost all of the names of every student in each of his 150 student classrooms. He teaches the material simply, and tests on what he\'s taught us in class - nothing came as a surprise, ever. Very accessible.;
I clickers, homework every night, test every two weeks, assigned readings that have nothing to do with physics besides justifying his teaching schedule. But he is really passionate. Imagine Vlad the Impaler for gym trainer. You\'re gonna get results but gonna but it\'s gonna hurt! You\'re taking this class because you have to. Don\'t take Vlad.;
Solid fella. Science made entertaining!;
I really enjoy the amount of attention he puts into trying to understand where his students are coming from. He is obviously passionate about his subject and has great practical knowledge which brings the philosophical concepts we study down to a workable level for Undergrads.;
Whole outline of class is done by working in groups. Very very little class time spent on lecturing and more focused on working at your respective groups. He\'s extremely intelligent and further sparked a passion in politics for me. Don\'t take if you\'re wanting an easy class. He makes you work for it.;
very nice professor. class is very easy. 2 easy papers, midterm and final. gives review sheet for midterm-what\'s on the review is what\'s on the midterm. Only one problem-way too many articles!! You definitely can\'t go wrong if you take him. He is definetly recommended! :);
"Ms. Hafeez seemed ill-prepared for class, and normally just winged her teaching. Still, as long as you do the homework, quizzes, and in-class ""poppers"" (daily-work that she uses to check attendance), than you\'ll be fine. This class is easy to pass, as long as you do the necessary work.";
Professor Gadbois was very organized;
Great teacher, entertaining and nice. TAKE NOTES. Tests are a little difficult and the research paper sucks! But if you do the work and get it in on time you\'ll get a good grade. Very fair.;
Perfect teacher if you can teach yourself math, so just come for quizzes, & to ask what will be on the quizzes (which he will tell you). His accent & writing is rough, don\'t take if dependent on teacher explanation. Very generous with points on tests, attempts will get you far. 20% -weekly quizzes 20% -Midterms (2) 40% -Final;
I loved taking Professor Rising! the classroom environment is very easy going. her lectures are super easy to get through because she uses stories from her life to get through it as examples. really wish i needed other sign classes because i already miss her;
*Soong Sohng. Not Steve. He\'s AWESOME! He\'s so funny in his own way...lol. He\'s always smiling and willing to help. I love how personal he is with the students. He\'s so incredibly smart and loves to talk in and out of class. My favorite teacher in Clarion!;
Almost finished with my BA in History, I really like to reflect upon my history class with Prof. Timmons. He is tough, but you will rarely find another Prof. as knowledgeable. I would recommend him to anyone who is serious about history or, simply enjoys actual learning and is not afraid to work for it!;
Solid professor for the most part. Homework load is insane if you have other heavy courses. If you love to read and write take his class. He can be a bit arrogant at times, but he is very qualified and knows his stuff. Do not fall behind on journal or review question assignments if possible. You will get an A if you work hard for it.;
should avoid no help at help never get a chance to ask question;
She is old-fashioned in her approach to teaching the subject matter. She is definitely not a political scientist and is probably best suited for a different discipline altogether. I found her courses to be poor preparation for graduate school.;
Dr. Sipple is absolutely amazing! Her discussions are always interesting and never fail to get me thinking. I love most of the books we\'ve read and she brings up points that I wouldn\'t have thought of otherwise. In addition to this, she\'s super understanding and kind! I\'d recommend her any day.;
She is awesome. Take her for online health class. Easy A (if you do the work she requires (which is not tough at all). She is always ready to help also, she is very clear and fair.;
As I\'m sure for many who are reading this I am not in the music program nor am I an expert even after this course. But it was a really easy to pass course, professor Lindahl offers a ton of extra credit and you can\'t not get a 100% on the online homework and quizzes. If you need a music class for graduation this is the way to go.;
She speaks really quickly and it\'s sometimes hard to take notes, but she gives out powerpoints. she makes her classes interesting and fun with her silly stories. hard marker but gives amazing feed back. overall, one of my favorite teachers in the program!;
Tabitha is stict and pretty dense on the material. She obviously knows what she\'s talking about but she moves really fast though her lectures, leaving the class scrambling to jot everything down. Her quote ID\'s are obscure and difficult to succeed in without memorizing the whole text. But she is a fair marker in other regards.;
Whip-smart and clearly an expert in her field (19th century British lit.). Doesn\'t take any bull. Highly respected at McGill. Go to her office hours.;
Hard class for the graduate students, even more torturous for the undergraduates. Horrible book-- both book and Gao expected a lot of prior knowledge, but he\'s very helpful as long as you ask. Go to his office or ask him quetsions in class. Good Luck!;
Does not adjust grading for in-class essays. Grades as if they are done out of class. Nitpicks explications. Journals were pointless because only received feedback on a few. Majority of journals are collected on the last day of class. Grading them beforehand would have been helpful.;
He is an excellent professor. He knows the material he is teaching. I enjoyed his class because he tried to connect the past and the current events. He does his best to make the class interesting and also is very kind and tries always to help his students. I only had 1 midterm, 3 papers and 1 final. Take him! He is a very nice professor.;
Man can he talk! I would often find myself zoning out. He mostly just reads directly from the book for the entire class period without showing any visuals or anything interesting. One redeeming quality is that he is extremely funny, and injects his humor throughout. Your entire grade is dependent on the two tests: midterm and final grades.;
GEOG 1200 online and it was a fair amount of work. The problem is that his quizzes are not reflected by the material learned. There would be a true/false or MC that had a graded answer different from what the book said, so that was not fair. Also he did not give feedback on why you got the grades you did on discussion posts and essay questions;
Overall, this class was petty. There\'s no textbook and slides are posted online before class. However, you will still need to go to lecture in order for you to know his anecdotes or opinions that he often puts on the exam. The material was not hard, however, it was not fun and can become time consuming. Cooke is a funny professor tho;
Tests are kinda hard but he cancelled the final and gave everyone a 100, the lowest test grade out of four including the final was dropped so it essentially counted for a third of the grade;
he\'s a terrible lecturer, goes on tangents so often. he also sometimes confuses himself;
I\'ll try to be objective and critical, something that this professor is not. The most BS class I\'ve ever taken. His lectures are tangental, without evidence and leaves you thinking that only 85% of what he said is true. His exam questions are his interpretations of the readings, not the author\'s actual points. Any answer could be correct.;
He fine tunes your stuff. No big revelations about writing except it takes time and lots of drafts to come up with good stuff. Very reasonalbe in research component. Funny guy.;
Tests very hard, failed everything except made a C on final and somehow managed to make a C in class, if you are having a hard time go talk to him about it act interested in his class and if you are a girl act interested in him and he will pass you, dress cute and flirt, but class is pretty hard;
Mr. Ballantyne is an amazing teacher. You are allowed to miss six classes without it effecting your grade. There are 4 to 5 speeches. As long as you keep improving and meet the required time you\'ll get an A or B. Just do not miss the day of your speech because you can NOT make it up, you will receive a zero. VERY kind and caring. Wants you to pass!;
Overall great teacher! Make sure to read the book and do the study guides before each test, the tests get harder and harder.;
One of my favorite professors at Emory. Really awesome lectures that I actually enjoyed going to and fair albeit difficult tests.;
Very fun class, nice teacher. Loved the set up of the online course and no text book use.;
Tyler Spalding is the best aerospace teacher you can get. He is a purist, so while you may have more work to do, you understand the material to a greater extent and he grades quite liberally.;
She is very kind, although hard to understand. Has a great grading scale and gave extra credit very often in lectures. Will stay after and help you comprehend.;
Dr. Lombrana is the best teacher I have ever had. He actually cares about his students and wants them to not only do well in his class but in their future careers. He does make you work for that grade though.;
I\'ve loved Professor Praitis\'s class. She manages to explain a lot of pretty difficult concepts in easy-to-understand terms. Lab independent projects are a lot of fun, and she\'s always more than willing to help you with anything lab- or class-related. Quizzes require you to show your knowledge rather than vomit up a bunch of stuff you\'ve memorized.;
Not nearly as easy as expected. Had to teach myself the course material because he is not only hard to understand, but also does not explain things well at all. He provides old tests as study material, but sneaks in several unexpected problems. He is known for giving wrong answers in study guides without even realizing it. Take someone else.;
Dr. Thielen was probably the best professor I\'ve ever had at PVCC. He is helpful, considerate, and SO clear in his direction. I learned a lot from his class. He comes highly recommended, as long as you\'re willing to really do the work, read the book, and study for the tests.;
Great teacher to take. Talks about the importance of effort and learning with passion. Love to take another class with her.;
Awesome guy a little slow grader but impossible to do bad i skipped a quiz and still got a 91;
Very helpful with providing any additional help needed for this course!;
Should\'ve listened to everyone on here. Not sure how this guy still has a job. Unreal requirements that would not apply in the real world. All based on what HE wants to see, not what is logical. Even if you\'re work is correct, it has to be done in his ridiculously specific manner in order, and you will STILL lose points. Avoid at all costs!;
Professor Masten had me concerned at the beginning of the semester however, I followed grading guidelines for discussion boards (which are easy) and essays and did well. The tests are a little more difficult because they are closed note/book and you\'re given a very limited time!;
Amazing! I looked forward to every class. He is extremely smart and one of the leading UCC scholars. If you listen to him, you will realize he is hilarious and a true gem. To pass, do the readings and go to class. He is always willing to talk to students after class on the bricks, so participate in that when you can.;
She is very simple. The class is clear to follow. She can be a bit of a picky grader, as she will not really give perfect scores for simple assignments. She does let you re-submit to gain back any lost points and lets you turn in late assignments. Easy to approach. Easy to get a good grade if you just go to class and do all the assignments;
I thought Yasmin was a great prof. The first day she specifically tells you the class will be boring, but it wasn\'t. She makes it interesting and has a good sense of humor. There were 5 exams total with no final and some compositions but they were all pretty easy and straightforward. If you go to class and pay attention you should get an A.;
Every professor should be like Professor Kozbelt. He was, hands down, my favorite teacher in college. I still miss his class one year later. Yes, stats is a challenging class, but for people going into this field and wishing to succeed, challenges need to be overcome. This teacher will fully equip you with what you need if you want to do well.;
He makes statistics very understandable. The course does not have as much math as I feared, I suck at math and this class was my favorite. 8 hws which you need at least an hour for, weekly quizzes worth ~2% each 2 exams and a final. You\'ll regret not taking him he is THE best professor for psych stats and you\'ll learn a lot. Oh and he\'s a cutie.;
BEST PROFESSOR EVER! She definitely expects you to work for your grade. Do the readings, do the homework, go to labs and class. Basically, be a responsible adult like you\'re supposed to be at this age. That\'s all there is to it. Go to her office hours. She will go above and beyond to help if you show the initiative. A+++++!!!;
took dr. c for psychopathology and he was incredible! he definitely isn\'t easy, but you learn a LOT and he is extremely helpful and insightful . he\'s also been my advisor and he\'s been awesome in that regard as well . i\'d highly recommend taking him if you\'re willing to work hard & want to learn!;
Took this class & language with him, again saw two sides. I recommend this to everyone its very light, fun, he\'s an amazing person and professor and is very passionate about Japanese language and culture. If you took Japanese with him but not this don\'t be afraid of this he\'s like a totally different prof in this class then what he is in JPNS 1100.;
Professor Woody explains concepts in more than one way so everyone can understand. She is enthusiastic about the subject, which makes lectures engaging. The TAs do most of the grading, but she is there at her office hours for extra help or clarification. This was by far my favorite class of the quarter.;
Irvine made the course much more enjoyable than the topic alone. Content was fairly interesting but not riveting. Most fair and clear exams and grading criteria I\'ve experienced so far. Incredibly helpful and approachable in office hours. You need to study to do well, but you 100% get the grade you earn, which I love. Irvine is fantastic!;
Financial Markets one of The most imperativo al Courses from Finance (15-3) Curriculum with Andrew lo very Inspirational;
When i took Fin 15.401 was called Finance Theory. He is funny and gives amazing lectures . The Exams are a little Hard but manageable. He gives an Excelent Foundation of Managerial and Corporate Finance . He leads the Laboratory for Financial Engineering thats awesome. Is a Finance Master mind;
Favourite first year prof, genuinely cares about students. With pre-lecture quizzes, assignments, etc., he gives you more than enough of a chance to bump up your grade. His midterms/exams are very reasonable. DO THE ASSIGNMENTS and GO TO CLASS: oftentimes midterm questions will be taken straight from assignments and in-class questions.;
He is rude. When you talk to him, he turns your back towards you and starts talking to somebody else. On the final exam, he changed the order of the questions but forgot to change the order of the answers. In addition, the scanner missed some answers. We were shocked when we received the results but he would not believe us that something went wrong;
Hilarious guy. However, I found I was doing lots of self-learning. He is not the best at explaining concepts, and some parts felt a little rushed like rotational dynamics. However, he is so generous with marks. He gives tons of extra credit and the questions he asks on assignments and tests are very fair. If you did well in grade 12 physics ur good;
Reviewers say Czajkowski is rude, but that\'s because no one understand sarcasm these days. I found him to be very nice/genuine outside of lectures (office hours), where you can talk to him 1 on 1. Many complain about how heavy the course is, but assignments are optional (bonus points). 1331 kids are also salty since they didn\'t take HS physics.;
I enjoy Chef Anne, she is my favorite teacher her at el Centro, and I can tell she loves her students as well as baking, She is an amazing woman, and is willing to experiment new receipts with her students.;
No Comments;
Love, love, love Dr. Wall as a teacher. I have had her for several classes in my graduate program. She is VERY well organized with class content - there is no way to mess anything up or not to understand what is expected. I love that she uses Schoology for the class setup - it is a million times better than D2L. Wish I had her for undergrad classes;
This class is a definite GPA booster. About half of the time you won\'t even be in class the entire time. If you have questions, she answers them fully. The course layout was very easy to interpret.;
This class was very easy. If you missed class its fine because she records the class. She goes straight to the point which I loved because I never stayed the whole time she usually finishes in about 30 minutes then you can do whatever you want.(which also means leave) Some class periods we did stay long on some of the more challenging topics;
Very easy class, but she can be a bit rude. Class consists of busy work and a few projects which you will have plenty of time to do.;
Gilson is hands down one of the best professors I have taken at OU so far and this class wasn\'t even for my major/minor. She is so inspirational, hilarious, and down right fantastic. Expect to write (duh) but have tons of fun while doing it! She legitimately made me think I chose the wrong major for myself just because of how interested I became.;
She\'s weird, but in a good way. You\'ll read a lot in her capstone, but it\'s a very inviting and pleasant atmosphere. She\'s a professor that really truly engages with what she reads and works hard to make sure everyone is just as excited about the novels. Some work - but it\'s one of the most memorable classes I\'ve taken here.;
Where to start? Annie is the BEST. I honestly owe so much of my academic and personal growth to her. She takes time both in class and out of class to make sure her students are okay and understand everything. Supportive, fun, AMAZING. Love her. Mentor, teacher, supporter. Speaks her mind and supports you for doing the same. Favorite prof ever.;
Wonderful professor. Generous with her time. Cares about students. Gives honest, helpful feedback. Knows her stuff. One of my favorite classes at OU.;
James is a fantastic teacher. If you bomb the midterm or final it will not kill you. The inquizzitives he gives are impossible to fail and are an easy A. He is heavy on reading. The debates he gives are fantastic and another easy A. I would definitely take him again!;
This dude is incredibly well-spoken and humble. He never talks down to his students and always respects their views. He makes the class a very chill experience, and as long as you do the inquisitives, you will definitely pass. In terms of the tests, he lets you use an index card and I\'d recommend just writing timeline, so you can nail chronology.;
Clear, straightforward, understandable. Teaches all necessary material well and prepares you for tests. Hand-written short homework daily, I would suggest doing them for practice. Gives a couple tests but they are short and fair and he tells you what type of problems will be on them. I would definitely recommend Dr Haque.;
He\'s not bad, not especially good. If you\'re cool with physics mechanics, you got it. If not, it\'s not easy to get help. The first 9 weeks you can skip some classes, later you learn things. he checked attendance randomly 6 times over the semester.;
This class is good for an easy grade. You don\'t learn anything. If you are majoring in history, find another professor. You will not learn a thing, but you will get an good grade.;
Very dry lectures. Just show up and understand what he is saying. All assignment are tutorials on database. He is very easy going. 1 mid term 1 final . Very easy grader. Class is on PL/SQL basic like triggers, Big data database SAP hana and a little mongo db.;
"I took his night class that was held on Mondays @ 6. It was a good class. He doesn\'t ""actually"" teach. However, I did not mind that at all. In fact, much of his class was straight to the point. You hear a small number of speakers, watch some movies, take 3 quizzes and 1 final exam";
Barry is a very good teacher, he will adapt his lecture depending how fast the class is going and will give very helpful advice at recitation.;
Great teacher, knows his stuff and knows how to teach. People who complain are the ones who did not try and were playing games on their laptops in class.;
GREAT PROFESSOR. TAKE HIS TIME TO EXPLAIN THE COURSE. REALLY DOWN TO EARTH. WISH I COULD TAKE HIM AGAIN. PASS WITH AN A+.;
he is the best college professor i have ever had!!! his classes are very interesting and he is very flexible and funny.;
You need the book for his class if you want to pass the test. He gives you the test on Angel & then you take the test once again in class. I would suggest make friends and split up the test by chapter amongst yourselfs to make it easier. You don\'t need to take notes, so don\'t even bother.;
For this class your homework consists of writing a paragraph about some type of engineering based topic. If you show up you are pretty much guaranteed to pass. The hardest part of this course is attending two Engineering Society meetings, which is a no-brainer. You also get to take apart a lawnmower, nothings more fun than that.;
Super helpful. I have never worked on a lawnmower before but she was very understanding in the lawnmower lab and was quick to answer any questions we had. Go to class. It\'s not hard and it\'s an easy A if you just show up. Lectures were usually really short;
This is the easiest class an ME major will take and Dr. Todd makes it a lot of fun. You really have to try to not get an A+.;
One of the best math professors I\'ve ever had. Attendance isn\'t optional, however if you attend most of his classes, he\'ll give you extra credit at the end of the semester. Final was lightweight and took half of the period. Real chill prof, will be taking him again in the future.;
Best teacher I\'ve had at Pierce in my two years here so far. I highly recommend taking his class if you get an opportunity. Very clear grading with very manageable work loads. He always sets dates and lets you know what is due when and how to do it. Gives answers on all homework. Lots of extra credit opportunities. I ended the class with over 100%!;
Blake\'s lectures and examples are so clear I was able to easily get an A in this class. There\'s always opportunity for extra credit;
Easy class. A good and nice professor and very very easy class. Can find most of the answers via Internet and assignments are clear cut.;
"Not a whole lot of formal teaching (there were some lecture notes, but not every week), but the textbook he uses is very informational and easy to understand so ""teaching myself"" wasn\'t that much of a problem. Lots of extra credit opportunities. Would take again";
One of the easiest and best classes I\'ve ever taken. Homework was a breeze but exams require a little more work. Textbook is FREE online! Lots of extra credit, he raised my 93% to a 4.0 amazing.;
This class was really easy. Everything that was on the exam was somewhere in his lecture notes that he has for you on canvas. If you read those, and do the assignments, then you should be fine.;
This professor was awesome! He gives a lot of opportunity for extra credit, way more than any other professor I have had. It\'s really hard to fail this class. He drops the lowest of 4 exams which means if you like your grade, NO FINAL! Homework and discussions you get full points for just for turning it in on time. There are no surprises!;
By far the best professor in my four years here at Highline.;
dr bob is the best proffessor i have ever met you have to take his class to believe he touched my heart, he does everything possible for you to pass the class he has extra credit and he is flexible. you will love his class;
Dr. Bob is such a great teacher. Yes, his lectures are long, and his reading assignments are very (very, very, very, ...) long. But, in the end, it is all so worth it. Make sure you know how to take good and efficient notes. Don\'t be that one student who looks lost during lectures. I would take his class over and over again if I could. Just do it!;
Great professor. Cares about his students. As long as you do your work and extra credit you\'ll pass.;
I enjoyed Dr. Bob a lot since he made his lectures engaging. He also sets up the classroom for you to interact w/other peers. If you need to take this course for credit, I definitely recommend him. Take good notes-it\'ll be all the material you need on exams. Use notecards, go thru the book, and remember key definitions. He gives bonus!!;
One of those professors that you\'ll remember for the rest of your life. His lectures are engaging, funny and packed with information that sticks with you. He assigns a lot of reading and memorization because he wants the students to realize how much they\'re capable of. Every member of my class got to be friends with eachother.;
Dr. Betts is a wonderful teacher. He is always willing to help if you need any clarification on anything. Really knows his stuff. He makes you work for your grade, but he\'s fair and clear on what he\'s looking for.;
Took this last year but he was a very nice professor. He was very helpful and if you do exactly as he instructed and follow his outline then youll be fine. I was very anxious to take a public speaking class but I left the class becoming more confident in public speaking. 10/10 would recommend. Research matters A LOT.;
Dr. Filson is a wonderful professor. I came away with an unexpected tremendous amount of knowledge about the Earth! It\'s a tough subject that he makes fun and interesting, and he\'s pretty forgiving in his grading. Do the reading and study guides, show up to class- you\'ll do well. I highly recommend him, and I\'d love to take another class of his.;
Mr. Filson is a very kind and understanding professor. It is not the easiest class, but if you work hard to understand what he is saying, you will get a good grade. Before the tests, he gives answers to the study guide, which really helps understand what will be on the test. I would love to take another one of his classes and highly recommend him!;
Mr. Filson is hands down the best instructor i have encountered at Grcc! He goes above and beyond his duty and comes to class earily often! It is not a easy class but if you put in the hard work, ask questions(which he is always glad and eager to answer), and attend class you should do well and even if you dont, you will learn to love his class.;
I took Mr. Young for College Trigonometry. You can tell right away that he really loves math and he really loves teaching. Trigonometry isn\'t easy for a lot of students but he really tries his best to explain everything as best he can. I\'ve now moved on to Calculus and the fundamentals he taught are helping out a ton!;
It\'s math, you have to work on it daily if you want to understand the concepts. This professor also created and posted videos of him teaching each lesson. Watch them and take notes and you will do fine. He is actually quite hilarious in the videos and makes learning less intimidating. There is extra credit and he helps anyone, just ask!;
Very annoying voice. She will get very easily upset with a class and will baby you in GBA 145. The material in the class is what makes it super easy-- study skills, how to use University resources, etc. so the class is dumb anyways.;
Nicest teacher I have ever had. Creates many opportunities for you to make extra credit.;
A student and 2 year assistant. I know WBL. Positive: Dr. Leatham offers passable classes. Minimal effort decent grade. Knowledgeable. Online reading and exercises mandatory. Negative: Egomaniac. Avoids questions. Lectures off-topic. Often late. Humor, problematic when the focus is personal. Be careful what you say. It will be remembered.;
really enjoyed this class. His lectures are messy but be an adult and organize the information to how it makes sense to you. Go to office hours for any extra help, he is really a sweet man and very excited to teach.;
Really enjoyable prof! Loved attending lectures and exams were really easy;
Unreasonably hard exam, fun fact, rivers macro econ filled up right after Hammond\'s final exam.;
i have had him for 2 classes now. He is great. Pay attention in his classes and show up since he gives points for attendence. I got a 4.0 both times ive taken him. Love him!;
Text for Stress Mgmt class unnecessary & waste of money, all covered in class. Dont see why the book is required. Spouting personal opinions & insulting medical documents is unprofessional. Makes inappropriate comments, creates uncomfortable environment. students arent allowed to leave class for bathroom, wont be allowed re entry...?;
I enjoyed taking Theory 4 with Dr. Roter as he was very clear about what he wanted in each paper, had a mini-lecture about each piece in class, and was very timely about returning papers and grades. As long as you take notes and are in class, you will be able to keep up with the workload. I highly recommend taking this course with Roter.;
She has a hunger to teach everyone well. She deeply cares about education and wants to make sure everyone learns the material. She teaches great. She gives plenty of time to complete assignments. She also works with you to help you get a better grade if needed. Manageable workload. Easy Grading. One of my favorite teachers yet!;
Camilo is the man. If you\'re serious about learning all things film this is the man to learn from. He will be tough on you and he\'s very straightforward but it is for your own good. If you don\'t enjoy and take something from his classes then you are in the wrong field.;
He is honestly the best professor I have ever had at Dutchess. I\'ve been going to Dutchess for two years and out of all he professors I have ever had he is my favorite. He has a very thick accent, but he makes fun of it himself so it is all out of fun. He truly cares about your education and he wants you to do well. Absolutely amazing.;
Carol Topping is one of the best professors that I have had. She is very interesting and knows what she is talking about. Just do the work and turn it in on time and you will pass.;
I love Professor Topping. Literally the best professor you could ever have. She has plenty of opportunities for you to make good grades and receive the grade you want. With her class you should pass with ease. I just love her y\'all as you can see. I prefer you guys to take her class you won\'t regret it.;
LOVE her!!! Best teacher at Vol State by far.;
One of the best professors at vol state. She is absolutely incredible and truly cares about each of her students. I was actually so sad on the last day of class because I loved her so much. I recommend this class to literally anyone. It will help you tremendously because she has a huge heart and loves her students.;
Prof. Topping is a great instructor who cares about her students and wants them to succeed. Show up, do the work, show interest in the subject, and you\'ll get an A no problem.;
She was so understanding! I tore my ACL and had to miss a ton of class, and I still made it out with an A+;
She\'s AWESOME! Sad day leaving her class for the last time. She\'s hilarious, keeps you interested, and really wants for every student to pass. There\'s no way anyone should fail her class.;
Take this class!! Professor Top wants you to do well in her class and she makes it very easy to do so. She makes the material easy to understand and provides real life examples.;
Top is a great professor and is incredibly intelligent. Do not underestimate her. She is hilarious and class was always super enjoyable, I actually wanted to go even though I knew it wasn\'t necessarily mandatory. She\'s great, if you have the opportunity to take her, DO!;
Top was absolutely amazing, I would take all of her classes if I had the time and money. She makes college fun and I love her to death.;
Topping is an amazing professor. She is full of hilarious stories and will make you laugh every class. She is super kind and easy to talk to. I am taking her courses again this fall.;
Good teacher. Always there to help. Easy A. Only 3 tests that are 35 questions each.;
She has experience in the field, so she knows what she is talking about and provides good insight. Has guest speakers. Attendance not mandatory. Will do anything to help you, if you ask.;
She\'s nice, lectures are easy in the sense that there\'s no participation and we get out of class early a lot. She can be confusing though in lectures and rambles. We watched a lot of videos and had some guest speakers. We don\'t really have review sessions for exams and they\'re pretty hard. She won\'t go over exams with you after the test is taken.;
Great, solid professor. People complain about the Electronic Journals, but c\'mon, all he is asking you to do is write a response to a specific question he asks about the reading in 5-7 sentences. There are only 10 Electronic Journals, and two 3-4 page papers in this class, so its a breeze. Dr. Cherry is super knowledge and has tons of experience.;
He is very nice and wants to help if you go to him for help. Read the material before class to actually understand what he is saying. Rewatching the lectures before the test also helps.;
Best pick for supervisor. Provides detailed feedback. VERY respected and insightful. Lectures get long and tedious, but he provides you with all the info you need for essays. Read the material for multiple choice not just slides. SWEETEST prof. on St Pats. Often given the street name OBrizzle. Because he is our homeboy. WE LOVE HIM.;
He\'s really into musical films and gives very clear lectures but he can be rather repetitive and drag on subjects. Also, he is incredibly soft-spoken. Sometimes you can\'t hear him over the classroom\'s central heating. He uploads lecture slides and assigns readings. Study all that and you barely have to come in for class.;
Tells you exactly what you need to know and all information is in his power point lectures, even if you don\'t understand the book helps a lot! It can be tough but as long as you pay attention and study you will do well!;
Chef Chris is wonderful and a must have here at El Centro, you wont be disappointment with his as an instructor. He does get upset if you don\'t listen and follow instructions.;
I have taken her class(Span & 121) a year ago, and now I am taking her second class (Span & 122). She is one of my favorite teacher in NSC. This is because I learned so many valuable things through taking her class. I am now speaking 4 languages including Spanish. Just take her class if you are interested in learning Spanish.;
Everything said before is true, he can be arrogant and he does mark ridiculously hard but all for the reason of improvement. My first essay was a C and after taking his feed back and applying it to my writing I improved a whole letter grade. This is university, teachers are not going to hold your hand. He knows his stuff and expects you to work;
Dr. Fields does lecture a lot but he tells stories to go along with it to keep your interest. There are almost no assignments in this class, but the tests are pretty tough. Even though there are only 3 tests, including the final, they are pretty much your entire grade. The textbook isn\'t mandatory, but it will help.;
If you dont pass with an A in this class then you did something wrong. Only thing you do all year is lectures and there are 3 test. If you get an A on the first two then you dont have to take the final test. HE GIVES YOU THE TEST AS A STUDY GUIDE, literally hands you the exact test just look over notes and power points.;
Easiest class I had last spring semester! Mrs. Herbert is a very inspiring and amazing instructor! She helped me so much and inspired me to keep following my dreams! As long as you listen, show up for class every time, do the work and ask questions, than it\'s an easy A. I received an A+ in this class, I would take her again in a heartbeat!;
Easiest college class Ive ever taken. She gives a lot of small easy assignments. A lot of points in this class which helps if you decide to not do one or two. Easy class, and her being very attractive makes it easy pay attention!;
I learned a lot just from talking with her, she\'s very inspirational! She is one of my fave teachers and I recommend her for computer classes. She was super caring and would answer any questions you had. I passed this class with an A, just do the work and you will pass no doubt. I loved her though, she\'s super sweet!;
If you ask her for help she\'s very helpful.;
The class is about Excel,Word,PowerP,&Access. She goes through all, if you know much about functions and querying in these program you will do just fine. She teaches you the basics and then goes very in depth so pay attention. Everything comes from the book so don\'t hesitate to get ahead of the game. Grading is amazing hundreds of points & likeable;
This is a great teacher! Thorough, helpful, very punctual. She always got back to me to help, even on the due dates, which were on Sundays! She made videos about my work personally to help me really understand. Love her, and wish I could take the nest class with her. Do the work and you will get good grades. Book absolutely necessary.;
I completely disagree with most of the comments about Professor Johnson. The reason all of you think badly about her classes is simply because MATH IS HARD! I was never good at math but I got an A in her class simply because I payed attention! If you don\'t do good in her class it\'s simply because you did not pay attention!!!!!;
Dr. Midkiff is a phenomenal teacher and a really nice person. Considering how difficult thermodynamics is, he makes it very understandable. He includes tons of practical application examples in his lectures that make them engaging. Great sense of humor too. I highly suggest him for any thermo course at this school.;
Good prof and a funny guy. His lectures can run a bit long, but his sense of humor and tangents keeps them interesting. 99% of what you do in class translates exactly to the tests. He also makes accommodations for the way the online HW works, so getting the grade there isn\'t too hard. Just makes sure you don\'t underestimate his tests and do well.;
He is the head of ME department. He has been teaching thermo for years. His lectures can be dull and put you to sleep. He goes off topic a lot with his stories. Homework is not due till end of semester but keep up to do well on tests. The redeeming value is his tests are easy and curves very generously.;
Pretty easy class. A lot of the math-based problems are just plug and chug. Be careful with the conceptual stuff. Look at the notes he puts online, pay attention in class, do the homework, and you\'ll be just fine;
Great prof, very inspiring. Some found her lectures too boring, but I really liked that she scripted it beforehand - it cut down on rambling. Lectures were very useful, more often than not there was new and interesting material. Readings were interesting, syllabus was constructed well, and assignments were light.;
Craig is an amazing teacher, probably my favorite and I do not like science classes. He\'s quirky and a little weird at first but you will love him by the end, he\'s hilarious. Do not take bio 103/104 if you do not like going outside because that is all you do. If you do like going outside, it\'s an easy A. No homework except to read. Study for tests.;
Craig is my absolute favorite teacher of all time, I have taken zoology and man & environment with him and I am going on his field bio class to Costa Rica this winter. Zoology means a lot of memorizing but he gives a ton of extra credit on the tests and in the class in general so it is easy to do well. Man & environment was the easiest class ever.;
I took this class during the summer, we went outside almost every single day to walk along the lake, in the woods,& sometimes to do some very messy &gross activities. Going to class & outside earns you participation pts. He is not very good at conveying material in class so you NEED to read the book to do well on exams. There is LOTS of memorizing.;
This class was so much fun. Expect to go outside ALOT. The tests are hard but he gives SO MUCH extra credit, it\'s impossible to fail. He\'s just a great guy and loves nature.;
What a nice man! He cares about his students and is so helpful with assignments. He is very approachable and wants to help you when you adk questions or need inspiration. I was out sick for a while and he was so nice about it. Definitely take him.;
Labs are easy but if you don\'t show up you get a 0. If you\'re there its hard to fail. Lots of the lab material along with a 30 minute video every week has to be done outside of class.;
I had Dr. Fonseca for an honors seminar, but he was very helpful and available to the students. He is very quick to email back and was very generous when grading our powerpoint presentations. He may be different as a regular professor, but I was very satisfied with him as an honors seminar instructor.;
Consistent, organized, knowledgeable;
Reardon was fantastic! Lectures were super interesting and I learned a lot. If you ask him, he will help you and I even got to skip out on some assignments because I talked to him. Very easy class if you read the books and pay attention.;
Weekly discussion posts that had to be done, had to read the online textbook. TA posts notes on BB that were helpful for the tests. Tests were somewhat easy, answers are all in the textbook or in the lecture ppts. For a freshman level class, it required some more work than I liked. Read syllabus carefully, he required us to send a welcome email;
This is one of the best classes I have taken at Bucks. He really cares if you can protect yourself in the real world . You can apply what he teaches to you in you daily life.. This is a class i recommend for every student ... He is a great inspiration.;
He\'s probably the best professor I\'ve had. He really cares about his students and really prides in his lectures. In addition, his lectures are all available online just for anyone to use. The assignments he gave were easy, all you really need to do is attend his classes and you\'re all set. Plus his stories are great. His final was easy. Take it!;
I loved this class. He teaches from a sociology perspective and you learn so much. Quirky, blunt sense of humor-- and tells the wildest stories. One assignment per week, with a final at the end of the course. Show up to class, and do the weekly assignment. The classroom dynamic is lowkey and comfortable. Super cool guy. Highly recommend him.;
Amazing teacher. A philosopher more than a business teacher.;
Great teacher! Helps get one into the understanding of accounting easily. In order to succeed, you must do the homework although it is not mandatory.;
He\'s a great professor. He gives good feedback. The class was very interesting.;
Overall, he\'s just fine. He seems to push his political stance on students every chance he gets and argues with students when they don\'t agree with him. After a while I stopped attending class and still got 100%. If you turn your papers in he will give you the credit and probably not even read them. Its more graded on completion than anything else.;
I loved her as a professor, really nice woman. Tests aren\'t hard, although the essays can be difficult, but take it to her office hours and have her read it, she will tell you what needs to be fix. Gives opportunities for extra credit here and there.;
She is a wonderful professor and you can tell that she is knowledgeable about history. She makes the class interesting and I ended the class with an A with flying colors. Make sure to follow her essay prompts, do the inquisitive, and have the book open for the test. She also gives bonus points so that\'s a plus. She\'s great!!;
She is funny in a sarcastic way. Lectures are all over the place because she is clearly passionate about her class but the tests are easy with minimal studying and before every exam she does a review.;
Amazing teacher! Easy class, does attendance every class, and doesn\'t believe in teaching on Fridays. There are two paragraph papers due every Wednesday over interesting topics. You are free to have opinions, he doesn\'t judge. Really funny and will help you if needed. Even though you have a textbook, you only need it for study guides.;
He straight gives you the answers to the test, so if you listen you\'ll get a 100. You have easy papers every week. Easy A and he does not have class on fridays even though it is MWF;
I hope he\'s a better teacher than advisor. After two years with him, I walked in at the end of my junior year to ask about my thesis and he didn\'t even know my name.;
I had Reid for S121 and freshman seminar. Reid was a very understanding and amazing professor. She knew that people got jitters speaking in front of crowds and wouldn\'t penalize you for it. She could tell who put work into their speech and she would grade accordingly. Always asked questions about your topic and was interested. Great Professor.;
She is great! Very helpful and so enthusiastic about her job. She made the class very fun to be in! Has quizzes about what you talked about in the class the day before, has great study guides as well.;
BEST professor I\'ve ever had Makes the class extremely easy to pass,allowed to do extra credit throughout the semester You have to go to class because it is a lab class, obvious. Her lectures are super easy to comprehend and remember, she does review before every exam so its impossible to fail. She posts the textbook outlines on BB;
Honestly it all depends on the student. I\'m not good at biology at all, but reading the book actually helped a lot because I wouldn\'t grasp anything while I was in lecture. There are 4-5 midterms which are way better, than just the one because it\'ll be 2-3 chapters at a time rather than chapters 1-10 for only 1 big accumulative midterm. Take her!;
I thought bio was going to be very boring, but she managed to make it so much fun to the point that i was looking forward to her class & lab. She gives easy hw, she will tell you everything that\'s on the tests, & will have little reviews. She\'s willing to stay after class to help out. She\'s super sweet & her lectures are awesome! would take again!;
Lets you know exactly what will be on the upcoming tests (as long as you stay until the end of class)! Extra credit is easy -- things like go on a hike, or draw and label a cell. She\'s a great instructor.;
Far and away the worst teacher I have ever had!;
All her test are online, don\'t stress. They can be taken more than once.;
Awesome class with awesome professor. Will use these skills for the rest of my life! Thouroughly enjoyed this class with Woolard.;
Doc is the best campbell has to offer. So down to earth an easy. Take her. You want regret it.;
Great professor! Every test is online and you can take them unlimited times. Only 1 essay for this class. Very easy class!!;
Literally made me into the person I am today. Would not be where I am without her.;
floater. The text is the teacher.;
Very big ego. If you patronize him and stroke his pride you will do well. Make him look good at the ASHRAE competition and he will help you. If you challenge him he will lose his temper and his ears turn red. Smart but totally vain.;
Great teacher and I\'d advise taking him! He really helps out and the exams are a piece of cake if you study for them.;
Honestly i thought Dwayne Rurka was the best professor i have even encountered at N.A.I.T.. The lectures were interesting, he made sure the students were included in the arguments and he kept us on out toes. i really took in what he taught from his classes and have new respect for other perspectives. So i want to say thank you.;
I hardly ever went to class and still made an A. She kind of makes you feel stupid when asking a question, but she will answer it. She really knows her stuff and is very good at explaining things. I like math, and I really did enjoy her class... the few times that I went.;
He is very practical. His class always involve real world cases. And he is a easy marker. I will definitely take another class with him.;
Do not take her any way;
Her class was offered to me through APUS. She was very helpful, though there were quite a bit of essays and you truly had to try for your grade. We also had to read a novel chosen from her list for the final essay. BUT-- her grading on the final essay was very lenient.;
Dr. Blanck is such a nice lady, but she\'s an okay teacher. She\'s really not BAD, but shes not the best. Her classes feel long and her lecturing isnt too great, at least in y opinion. She uses powerpoints a lot, but make sure you write down what she SAYS, too. Shes so nice and will help you with anything that you need, even outside of class.;
Great Professor! He is extremely intelligent, personable, and very hot. He keeps class interesting by telling funny stories.;
His lectures are interesting for awhile, but sometimes you get the feeling that he just likes to hear himself talk. His tests are tough.;
Take her if you want an easy A and HAVE to take a language course. However if you are interested in learning french truley still take her because you want an easy A anyway you can get it right? But seriously if you want to learn french in her class you must really practice and persue it on your own because she is just a little too light for a true;
Ernie obviously knows what he\'s talking about and is very arrogant at times. However, I find him very helpful and he is always willing to go over things again, even though he looks at you like you\'re stupid. Not an awful class.;
Great class with a great professor!! would HIGHLY recommend;
Dr. Duma is one of the best lecturers in math. She explains in a way that makes it very clear what we need to know and what we don\'t. Her examples in class reflect directly what is going to be on the assignments/midterms and finals. She grades very fairly and is very kind. I would take her again!;
Duma will be a good fit for you if you\'re good at self-teaching. Her midterms/finals are made up of difficult textbook problems and are doable even without consistent class attendance. Would recommend.;
Easy marker. The beginning material is pretty simple so there\'s not much to discuss there. She does a pretty good job when the topics get a bit more complex, but since the course isn\'t proof-based there is quite a bit of handwaving when it comes to theoretical rigour (a necessary evil);
Very good prof. Explains the material very well.;
Will tell you exactly how to do well in her class, and will never set any traps. The lectures are clear and she gladly answers your questions. She may look stern to some people but she is actually pretty approachable and has great sense of humor. Go to class if you need to, do the homework and her practice exams, and you will do well.;
"Her class was a three hour lecture where she talked nonstop. Pretty impressive really. She definitely knows her stuff. We had three take-home ""tests"" which consisted of several questions which she expected answered like any paper. Lots of research needed to get a good grade. Most people got a C or low B. Very tough class.";
This class has A LOT of reading so be prepared to stay up to date on the homework, but everything assigned is very interesting. She is good at grading and responding to messages in a reasonable time. I genuinely learned a lot from this class!;
Dr. Dogru was extremely helpful all semester long. At first, I thought her accent was going to be difficult to understand, but I quickly adapted. She is one of my favorite teachers. It is fairly easy to do well in her class as long as you pay attention. There isnt much homework, and the tests are straight forward.;
BEST PROF hands down, extremely helpful guy. Goes out of his way to help and definitely someone to use as a reference.;
Best Teacher;
Dr Frank Mitchell is hands down the best instructor I\'ve ever had the pleasure of learning from. He is kind and intelligent, and he cares about his students and is more than willing to make himself available and approachable. He explains the material in a way that is understandable. I plan on taking more of his classes in the future. LOVE HIM;
Frank Mitchell is to-the-point. First day of class he tells you to get an A on the test you just read the chapter. You can literally ignore everything he says and read the book and get an A. He in an extremely entertaining lecturer even if he gets off track. There hasn\'t been a test without extra credit. He\'s extremely approachable and kind.;
He gives 10 bonus points every test plus extra credit constantly. You don\'t have to show up but if you do youll get the extra credit. Constantly tells nutty stories.;
Interesting! I wasn\'t sure I would pass at first because his style of teaching is a lot different. But as long as you read the chapters and go to class you will pass. His lectures are awesome. You will learn a lot about life. Brilliant man!;
Lectures about himself. unbelievable stories. Guy is stuck in the 1960\'s. Literally didn\'t show up for our final. Easy A if you show up, but if your paying out of pocket not from financial aid or mommy and daddy. I was hoping to learn more. Very outdated teaching style. If your taking for credits, go for it. If you want to learn. forget about it;
This guy is very interesting. His lectures aren\'t really helpful when it comes to the tests. With that said he gives a lot of extra points during class so showing up is a good idea. If you read the book it\'s an easy A. He does have a tendency to drone on about himself but the stories are pretty funny (and almost unbelievable).;
"This professor rambles for 2.5 hours about stuff marginally related to the chapter at best. Self-centered and conceited, he believes no one is smarter than he. Doesn\'t really teach. Tells you first day to get an ""A"", read the book, but also to not trust the book. Would not recommend overall.";
This professor will teach you more than any other professor at CCC. He lectures for the entire class, but they\'re always interesting. If you have an open mind and enjoy critical thinking, this is the guy for you. He will willing to help and clarify anything if needed.;
He is a nice person and I have found him to be more helpful in one-on-one situations. The lectures are not particularly helpful, since you are expected to do the bulk of your learning in studio.;
Professor Ream was a sweet old man and tries really hard to teach well, but it\'s a struggle. His lectures are wildly confusing and he goes off on tangents and abandons problems without actually showing us the answer. He gives a TON of extra credit and curves everything, so this class wasn\'t awful. If math is a tough subject for you, I\'d stay away.;
Fred Stewart is one of best professors I\'ve ever had! His class lectures are always interesting and keeps your attention. Class has 2 easy writing assignments and 4 tests that are easy because they cover vocabulary. Definitely an easy A if you put in a little effort. Don\'t have to take the final if your grade is high enough. Would take him again!;
If you come to class, take notes on the \'*\' items, and spend maybe 15 minutes looking over your notes and study guide before the test you WILL make a A. This class is a must take uni. studies course and a great GPA booster :);
The class was worth attending, so many cool examples that won\'t be found anywhere else. No textbook, no problem. Two writing assignments are straightforward four quizzes are easy if you take notes and study vocab. Do well and you can accept your grade without worrying about a final exam.;
Very easy class. Makes it very interesting. Only 2 assignments. No book. 5 quizzes I think but are super easy. Don\'t really even have to come to pass.;
Phenomenal lecturer. Lectures are two hours, so it takes stamina, but if you engage yourself it is completely worth it. Lectures blew my mind every day and although the readings could be long, I usually enjoyed them. It was a minicourse, so you get out of it what you put in, and it was worth it to put in a lot.;
Prof. Amrine is the best professor I\'ve ever had... extremely intelligent person, great to talk to, go to office hours! Take all of his classes. Your perspective on lifethe universeexistencephilosophywhatever it is will broaden... this is what college is all about.;
"It\'s a hard course, but you need to be focused on whatever he give to get an ""A"" grade. He is very helpful and will answer or clarify any question you may have. I really enjoyed this class and learned a lot . read read read your TEXTBOOK to understand, and if you don\'t you will regret that and everything will be very hard to understand.";
This professor is wonderful. I had him for two of my courses. His lectures are delivered as if in theatre so you cannot possibly fall asleep in class :);
Gay is a wonderful professor! I have taken her for two courses (ARH 390W and ARH 498). Each course consists of 2 papers and 3-4 Image Exams. Class consists of her opening with a fun video and lecturing with a PowerPoint. No notes need to be taken, she practically gives you the exam on the study guide. Great class and great professor!;
Loved this class! Lectures were boring sometimes, but it was an interesting class. Gay really loves teaching it, she will repeat that a lot. It is an easy class, not many assignments and the exams are all memorization. Would recommend! Easy A!;
My absolute favorite professor at EKU. She is incredibly kind and caring towards her students, will always make time outside of class and welcomes questions. She is extremely well versed and knowledgable in her subject. Dr. Sweely by far has had the most impact in my academic career. It was an absolute joy to have her as a professor!;
Very easy class. Easy grader, easy tests, you\'ll be fine if you skip here and there. All you gotta do is study the given study guides and you\'ll pass easily. We had 2 papers and you don\'t even have to try and you\'ll get a good grade. Highly recommend. ART 200;
Easy A. Took a 5 week summer course. There\'s about 300 problems due every week through the learnsmart program in a system called connect, plus 8 homework questions. At first I didn\'t understand why everyone said this class is easy. Then I realized if you use all your resources, you\'ll find that the answers are right in front of your face.;
This was a five-week class that I completed in three weeks with barely an effort. Exam questions are out of the textbook and the homework assignments give you instant feedback as to whether your answers are right or wrong. The instructor responded to questions through chat and was very generous with the extra credit that was available as an option.;
She\'s really sweet, but you won\'t get your assignments back for months most of the time. There\'s no tests or anything, but several papers, projects, a 40 page written/artwork journal, and a final 10 page paper complete with an art project. She\'s incredibly forgetful and often assigns things at the last minute and provides minimal instructions.;
"He is smart as hell, but didn\'t really ""teach"" - he just wrote on the board without consideration for the existence or uniqueness of any audience. Deciphering missing steps from the board was like solving a puzzle, and there wasn\'t much value in going to class (I went anyway). Lots of independent learning was needed! Nice exam, very challenging!";
I took this class during the summer, and it was a breeze! There are three tests and a cumulative final. Dr. Williams is funny, enthusiastic, and always has a smile on her face. She gave us fifteen minute breaks between lecture and film presentations and allowed us to eat during the films. If you\'re looking to knock out a fine arts credit take her!!;
Dr. Mann is an AMAZING professor. I had him for A&P 1&2. He is thorough in his lectures but not too much. If you want to learn extra, ask and he will tell you as much as you\'d like. I learned so much in this class. As long as you read the PowerPoints and pay attention you\'ll pass this class. Best professor I\'ve had.;
Dr. Mann rocks! If you PAY ATTENTION to his lectures in class AND online he gives you everything you need to be successful. He will explain anything to you, BUT you have to ask. This is not an easy class, AND YOU HAVE TO STUDY! The time you put in will directly show in your grade.;
I took his summer A&P I class and just like any other science, it was a difficult. But I did take the time to study and I passed with an A. He\'s a great teacher. He tells you exactly what\'s going to be one the tests. I had to write 2 papers, but the maximum length was 1 page and a half. And if you do miss a class, he has all his lectures online.;
The Online class is great. His test is basically directly off of his powerpoints . It is worth taking his class. He is easy and a down to earth teacher, which makes A&P easier to digest than others but A&P is naturally a lot of material by itself. I am in the nursing program. Just make sure your nursing program will accept an online A&P class.;
Heather is awesome. She\'s not easy but she is not that hard either. If taking modern theory make sure to read EVERYTHING in order to get a high grade. Every point counts because she grades right down to the .00%. The readings are dry and horrible but she makes the best of it and keeps you engaged. Make her like you, she\'s a good networking contact.;
No Comments;
This isn\'t one of those classes you can cruise through with minimal effort. Be ready to show up for class and to put in some real effort. The tests are tough, but you soon catch on to what she is looking for (lots of specifics!). I thought she was an interesting lecturer and used plenty of real-world examples to make the material relevant.;
Mr. Kinder is an amazing teacher that cares about his students. This is not an easy A class and you will have to work to acheieve an A. I recommend Ian and his class to anyone looking to take a self defense class. FYI this is a very physical class so be prepared to sweat.;
confuses everything, although information is directly from the book. Drops lowest quiz, but they carry heavy weight in terms of your final grade!!;
Spears is a really great prof! His course is very focused on the readings but he lectures very well and is really funny.;
Dr. Ian was one of the best professors Ive had at Eastern Michigan. I would recommend his section to everyone that wants to teach early education. Hes super relatable, funny, and has the most adorable British accent. Absolutely loved this guy.;
I\'ve had Ian so many times I\'ve lost count. Genuinely wonderful both as an educator and as a person. Each time I\'ve had him, I\'ve been asked to examine literature in new and impactful ways. Respectful and interested in the opinions of his students. You can\'t get away with not reading the books, though, so don\'t try it. He\'ll know. Highly recommend.;
Ian is a wonderful professor! He\'s thoughtful, understanding, and he loves a good class discussion. No quizzes, no test, just two writing assignments and a presentation. He gives great feedback on everything. He sometimes shares food with the class (ask about his walnut patÃ©), but he never shares the recipes - no matter how often you ask! :);
If you actually talk to him he is really sweet! If he knows you from talking with you he will help you out, most of the quizzes are group quizzes and he gives you the answers and extra credit! You have to read a lot but a lot is from the lectures. I would definitely recommend!;
Test day is a nightmare. She is very concerned with making sure it is done 100% correct, which is fine, but she can come across as very rude about it. She touched my arm and lifted my sleeve to look for a watch. The tests weren\'t that bad honestly. The paper was more difficult for me. She is very specific about APA format, so be careful with that.;
I took him for 2 semesters of Hebrew and he was one of the greatest professors I ever had.;
I throughly enjoyed her class, it was the easiest one I took all semester,. She is an excellent teacher and makes things fairly interesting;
great lady, but class is hard;
Professor Allard was a fairly solid professor. You could certainly tell that he was interested in what he was teaching. Sometimes it was hard for me to get anything out of the lectures however, because I felt some stuff he was talking about wasn\'t relevant and I had a hard time knowing what to write. I felt that he was also a hard marker.;
No Comments;
Definitely a great professor. I\'d graduated 10 years ago and still remember Mr. James Muckell as one of the best people I\'ve ever met. He made everyone feel as their family, in fact he was like a dad to me. Those who try to tarnish his name should be ashamed. I\'ll pray for you guys.;
I took him for Fall 2013 class. Dr.Tompkins is a Talented Professor with unique teaching style. Starting from our class, he started providing audio powerpoint presentations which turned out to be very helpful. Tests are very challenging, so pay attention to everything he says. Grade consists of a Midterm, Final or Group project and five quizzes.;
Had him for eMac my freshman year of art college. Great teacher, super helpful and knowledgable of what he\'s teaching. Class has a lot of freedom, but also just enough structure. Great lecturer as well. Highly recommend Jason!;
Jay is a straight forward professor. He teaches for concepts not for memorization, which is helpful. He is funny and occasionally takes the day to just talk politics with his class and get to know students. There are frequent quizzes but they cover literally exactly what he taught in class. Exams are predictable if you go to class and do the work.;
Took this class online and it was very easy. As long as you do the homework and practice exams it is an easy A.;
AWESOME!!!;
Dr. Kent is a very thorough professor. He gives a ton of information and the tests can be difficult. As long as you study the essay questions and notes, an A is possible. He gives a lot of extra credit on every test. Highly recommend.;
Dr. Kent is one of the best teachers I have ever had. He is very thorough and passionate about his work. He is very approachable, likeable, and generally a nice guy. He gives tons of extra credit on his exams but his exams are tough. He gives a study guide and will tell you what essay questions will be on the exam. You can pass with an A.;
Hands down the best A&P teacher at VSCC. He\'s infinitely knowledgable and doesn\'t just read from slides -- he physically teaches on a chalk board. Extra credit is available on tests as long as you really put effort into studying the material. Sometimes it feels like he\'s moving too slow, but it\'s all because he cares about student comprehension.;
I cannot understand how anyone can say that Dr. Kent does not offer feedback. He is always available after class and during office hours. He will answer any questions you have but you have to ask. Don\'t expect him to know that you don\'t get something. ASK HIM. Tests are intense but he practically gives you the test in his reviews! STUDY THEM!;
Kent is a great bio prof! For A and P, I recommend him 110%. I learned so much! It\'s a lot of memorizing, but he gives you study guides, out of class help, and extra credit on exams. Show up and pay attention, and you should get at least a C or better.;
Professor Kent is hands down one of the best professors I\'ve had my college career. He gives a ton of extra credit and tells you exactly what he expects and what he\'ll ask on his exams. He\'s extremely knowledgeable and a great person in general, a real gem. He always comes to class with a smile and a Hawaiian shirt on.;
Expect to read 4 novels during this course. No textbook, but she puts all relevant readings online for students. Expect to have to read an article and answer questions as homework for every class. Most of your grade comes from the extremely important book reports. Most class periods are spent gathering in a large circle and discussing as a class.;
Jim is one if the greatest professors I have ever met! a true mensch. he cares deeply about theatre so much so that even if you have a limited knowledge of theatre he engages you to constantly do more to grow! your knowledge is fed by the true genius of the mans knowledge. he invites the best of the best to come in to do workshops! take his classes;
Best art instructor I\'ve had so far.;
Best art teacher hands down, I learned so much from his classes and improved dramatically under his wing. He definitely cares about his students and will go the extra mile for students!;
I came to IU thinking I wanted to pursue an econ degree;
Joann is great. She really wants all her students to succeed and is always available to help you out if you have any questions. She taught a flipped instruction course which required a lot of studyingonline lectures for homework, but her lectures class activities always make the material easy to understand. Love her!;
Dr. Baker is a great professor. AEM 121 was super easy compared to what I\'ve heard about the other engineering intro courses.;
Dr. Baker is one of the best professors at Alabama. The class is extremely easy and more for getting you transitioned into the Aerospace program. Dr. Baker is always available to help, and genuinely cares about you.;
Dr. Baker really cares about his students. The homework in this class was optional and there were 8 tests and that may seem daunting but the tests were not difficult at all if you looked at the material and/or did the homework. This class could have been very hard but Dr. B went out of his way to make it easier for us while we still learned a lot.;
Great guy. Great Class. The schedule said this class met 3 times a week but he made it to only twice a week. Baker made class enjoyable even though it was a 9am. Definitely an easy A.;
Some people are not used to the terminology, so that can get confusing if you don\'t already have prior knowledge about anatomy. The two most important things are: attending lecture and taking really good notes. His tests are all based off of what he says, so re-read your notes to understand thoroughly.;
Before the tests, I just studied the text book and I never got less than a 90% on any of them. Because he gives you a FREE text book on the first day of class, you do not need to take notes. All the material he covers is right in the book. This spring semester of 2018 is his last semester ever, so NPVC will lose one of their greatest professors.;
Excellent teacher. I have taken both his ASTR110 and ASTR111 and have enjoyed them both. He keeps his lectures interesting and well-paced throwing in the occasional corny joke. Just attend the lectures and make sure to study thoroughly before every test and the class is an easy A. So hurry up and take this class before he retires!;
You show JC the effort and he will respect you back. There is a lot of knowledge in his head and a genuine interest in the students. Once you demonstrate your commitment you\'ll be freed to take your creations as far as you want to.;
Avoid at ALL COSTS!!!! He is a very rude and boring old man. His test has nothing to do with the material. 55 minute lectures feel like 55 days. Honestly if his class is the only class that makes you a full time student it\'ll be better to stay part time.;
Prof. Douglas really knows his info, it\'s obvious that he enjoys teaching. The class was strictly a lecture class, which is told on the registration website so if your expecting a hands on, exciting class, it\'s almost common sense to not sign up for a lecture course! Unlike much of the class, I attended every day and took notes. I got an easy A.;
Easiest class I\'ve ever taken. If you know how to do the bare minimum in Microsoft Office, you can get an A. Don\'t bother showing up on time, because he sure as hell doesn\'t. He makes you print out your assignments, so be prepared to spend money on the print service. He\'s old and confuses himself a lot, so be prepared to teach yourself.;
Enomoto is the nicest teacher of all time. He is very chill and does not yell. He also explains thing very well!;
Okay professor. He teaches at the beginning of class and then you do your own work. His tests are online, so better buy the code or you would not pass. The test is exact as the online work, so just review and you\'ll be okay. The only con is that he can be boring, but that\'s college.;
WORK HARD, PLAY HARD, he always says that. He\'s veryful and understanding,always making the class interesting.;
One of the best teachers I\'ve ever had. I doubt I\'ll forget him anytime soon.;
It was a very easy class. All we did was write a couple papers and talk about the book, yet I still left feeling like I had learned something. It was not what I expected for accelerated composition. Highly recommended.;
I loved taking ACCT 1010 and 1020 with Prof Janicek!!! He really does care about his students and wants to see them do well. He doesn\'t use HW as a grade, nor does he grade it but goes over it in class. He took 3 grades for each of the classes;
BEST PROFESSOR, I loved math class with Mr. Moliassa! He explains the curriculum pretty well and he\'s always available if you need help, especially if you show him you care about doing well in the course he will do his best to help you. Be prepared to work though. You won\'t regret taking math class with him.;
Moliassa is a really odd guy. He gets a little too enthusiastic about math. He\'s a good guy though and really helpful. He\'s good at making difficult topics easy to understand. Going to class is necessary to passing.;
I really liked this teacher, and his lectures were really interesting. The tests are easy if you take notes . You don\'t really need the book if you take good notes in class, and if you need help the TA\'s are the ones you need to talk to. He gave us the question beforehand so we could write an outline for the exams.;
Dr. B is pretty legit. He\'s super easy going. and there is no possible way to fail his class. People have legit sat in class and listened to music during his lectures and still make A\'s on tests.;
Fantastic class. You watch so many great films, and he gives great in depth back story to each. 5 quizzes, which are super easy, and 3 papers which are very manageable. Easy, and a very awesome guy, great sense of humor.;
Professor Campos is the sweetest, most easy professor I\'ve had. I was nervous to take Spanish since I hadn\'t since HS. She makes the content easy, and really works with you if you miss anything but make sure to tell her ahead of time. Quizzes and exams are pretty easy as well. I would love to take her for Spanish II if she ever teaches it again.;
She\'s as awesome as everybody says. She truly cares for her students and goes above and beyond to further assist in learning the material. She sends reminders, listens to her students needs, and always motivates her students. As long as you do your part, you\'ll do great. Must take her class if you\'re looking into taking a child development class.;
Dr. Douglas is so helpful! I had a mishap with the textbook company, they put me in the wrong class. For 5/8 weeks was working on the WRONG material. Annoying but she was understanding and gave me an extension for the material to be turned in! 1 paper, online quizzes/tests. Read and TRY and you\'ll be fine! Very respectful/responsive. TAKE HER!;
I took her for summer online, she was easy to get a hold of and has all your work put up the first day just don\'t wait till last min to do work. She gave plenty of time to do final and quizzes. I also had two discussion papers to write that are around 6 paragraphs. Overall an easy class, make sure you do work in a timely manner.;
The only reason I gave this professor a 4 was because of her lack of communication and her assignments were not clear 70% of the time. I took her online class ( I recommend if you want an A) I passed with an A because I did all the work on time, that\'s really all you have to do. Not hard at all, can be confusing at times that\'s all.;
This class is pretty much self pace, but if you get behind it will be hard to recover. Try to complete a test a week.;
"A class with Kate should be compulsory. She will expand your mind and educate you with skills and knowledge that will reach far beyond the classroom. Her ""Women and Politics"" class was my favorite during my time at USM. I carry the lessons learned with me in my life. Kate Greene: educator, teacher, inspiration.";
Kathy Haddad is one of the best professors at Chaffey College. She is so sweet and truly cares for her students. This class is not hard, just do your weekly readings in the textbook (usually about 20 pages) and take the quizzes every week. Two short research papers- very easy and some discussion forums, which were very minimal. 10/10 recommend!!;
Kathy is an amzing professor. She cares about her students but participation is a must. Following directions is key to this class and it is an easy A if you do what is required. She gives feedback and if you follow it you will succeed. I would take her class again in a minute.;
Kathy is AWESOME! She has a way of inspiring creativity and getting your mind working. Her instructional videos are hilarious and informative.;
Kathy is so much fun. But if you want to do well you much keep up and do your assignments on time. There is a lot of Internet videos to watch, many with her in them. They are a crack up, but you do learn a lot from them. Lots of work, but it is always fun. She is a great teacher.;
One of my favorite professors! I have had her for Photo 7 and 9, and am waiting to take 50. She is passionate about her craft, talented and loves teaching. She doesn\'t take herself too seriously and is great fun! Her classes are work with lots of info, but she uses a variety of media to teach it. Quizzes can be tricky.;
Throughout the class I was able to learn about different photography techniques I had no idea about. Important to mention, Haddad is a very hilarious instructor and easy to connect with.;
Professor Moore was amazing! Makes math super easy and explains everything very well. You do not need a textbook so you will save a ton of money!! I strongly suggest her :);
Dr. Milner is so great!!!;
Please drop the class bcz I have no words.;
The class is easy, you can learn by yourself without spending more money in this semester;
Dr. Peters is a nice guy and his classes are pretty easy... I didn\'t learn much but each class was a new adventure.;
After taking Spanish-301 with Professor Yager, I took Spanish-331 with him a year later based almost entirely on the fact that he was teaching it. His class is relatively entertaining and he is great at connecting with his students. Genuinely cares about the well-being of his students and understands the students\' perspectives.;
Hade a fun day with Kerry at my house and hope to hang out with him again;
Dr. Rahimzadeh is such a great professor! Lectures are always interesting (but DO NOT MISS THEM, because they\'re on the test), and he is hilarious. I didn\'t think anyone could make early lit fun, but he does. Two 1 PG papers and one 4-5 PG paper, and he\'s a little picky (but helpful!). If you take good notes and read the stories, you\'ll do fine. :);
He tells you exactly how to get an A, you have to work for it but if you\'re willing it\'s right there. He is always willing to talk to you, make accommodations, and really goes out of his way to help a student who asks for it. He says any version of the text book is fine but MAKE SURE YOU GET THE OLD VERSION.;
If you miss a class, make it up. Do not wait till the end to makeup the classes or you may run out of options or time;
She is so fun! Just make sure to not miss class, but even if you do, she allows as many makeup classes as you want! She\'s super cool.;
Amazing prof. Take SSH 105 with him and you\'re golden!;
I freakin love this man. Best professor I have ever had. His lectures are so clear and concise, he knows exactly how to speak so that everyone paying attention really understands. He also records his lectures and posts them so that students who miss class can easily catch up. His tests are very fair and true to the content. I loved him and his work;
pretty easy as long as u have him. just write what he emphasizes in class and you are golden. dont ever try to write in ur own words, just write down (to highest degree) what he says in class and lecture notes.;
such an easy course if your at least somewhat smart;
This class is an easy A. Kraay makes the content easy to grasp with tons of examples and his lectures are great! Would 100% take his course again!;
boring lectures, not direct, rambles, unorganized, time better used on reading textbook and studying. Material on tests aren\'t always covered in lecture/textbook/study guides. hard to know something when you\'re not told about it..take a different teacher, he\'s a nice funny old guy, but needs to update/review methods of his lecturing cause they suck;
Assante\'s lectures are basically the reading assignments regurgitated. Sometimes, he\'ll add a few videos, fun facts, and personal stories to make them not too boring. His quizzes aren\'t too hard, but his tests can be tricky. He offers a lot of extra credit questions and makes his own memes though.;
Took this online over the 10 week summer. At first I would read the book and then take the test and would do poorly. After that I just started to look the quizzes up on Quizlet. One group project, which wasn\'t hard at all and their was a storytelling speech and a informative speech. For the informative speech you have to have 5 audience members.;
Great Professor. Class is really discussion based so if that is not your cup of tea don\'t take her. If you go to her office she will give you help with anything. Also, study guides are exactly like the test, do them and you will at least get a B on the test!;
I would highly recommend taking Dr. Carnes and getting on her good side! She favorites students but if you participate in class and make an effort you\'ll do fine. Tests aren\'t hard. Make sure you study the study guide and you will be fine. Her personality makes class enjoyable and a fun learning environment!;
Dr. Hardy was a great professor. I\'ve read many negative reviews about him but those must have been the students who were expecting hand outs and did not show for class. Dr. Hardy is fair, you must comply when he tells you to show up for class and turn in assignments on time. He helped with test prep and gave extra credit. He was awesome! I\'ll SAY!;
I absolutely loved this class. I showed up for every class session. You have to unless you have a friend who is willing to give you the notes since she does not post powerpoints online. She goes in depth and you actually learn the subject matter. The tests are literally based on the notes and questions from the study guide. Overall, she is great!;
I loved Mrs. Newhart. 130S was a part Philosophy, part service learning class focused on teaching children philosophy but it was incredibly easy. I read none of the material but showed up & passed with an easy A. Some failed the first test, so the rest were take home essays. I wasn\'t interested in the material but I would recommend this class.;
Lots of reading followed by class discussion over material. You know ahead of time exactly what is expected for assignments. So if you want to actually learn and participate in class do the reading. If not do the readings when the assigned papers are due. With the least bit of effort you can get a great grade. She is lecture heavy.;
Dr. P is an odd character but overall Psych of Women is very easy. The class consists of 3 or 4 take home exams, and no homework or quizzes (very easy). She will go off on a tangent for hours if you let her.;
Dr. Perdue has her good moments but I would avoid her if you have the chance! She is super opinionated and shoots down others opinions before they even try to share. Very intimidating, does not like to answer many questions and rarely answers emails. She does allow for make up exams. The study guides she gives don\'t help much. Read the book!;
Best professor i have ever had, if had a chance, please take a class with her;
Best professor in the Menifee campus. Very easy and fun class coming from someone who used to hate english. I took her for 92 and 101 and now I am her SI leader (class tutor). I highly recommend this class. You can get an easy A if you keep up with the work. Wonderful person.;
Definitely going to choose Prof. Looney\'s class again! Interesting class and easy A. You can bring notes to exams so you don\'t need to remember a lot. Lots of bonus points available and the observatory sessions are awesome!;
Tests are based just off of the notes you take in class. Write down everything! If you can memorize all the notes then you should be fine. Some test questions are confusing. Gives a maximum of 3 percentage points for extra credit. Attend class every session that it is held and you will receive another bonus point. Overall, a pretty good teacher.;
Used Point System. To get an A we needed 320 ptS, she offered 710 pts. 2 tests and must get 50% to consider getting A. No final. Small quizzes in between (not required but if you want pts then take it) You can fail the quizzes and it wont matter bc its point based. Posts PPT lectures after class. I did so much extra work than I needed to.;
Very passionate about what she teaches. Have to buy TopHat for participation. Point Based System. To get an A you have to get 340 points, she offered 860 points! Her quizzes are online but very short. 10questions in 8mins so no time to use book/notes. Very easy to get A if you just PAY ATTENTION.;
She assigns a lot of readings, but you can get by without doing them as long as you take notes in class. Harsh grader on papers;
Definitely not my favorite prof. Learned more/better on mathlab then in class, because Im not too good at math and her teaching style wasn\'t good to me. if your already good youll do well but if not make sure you teach and prepare yourself and study in groups. lots of homework online before test, 4 tests and she gives lots of extra credit. STUDY!!!;
Easy work attendance matter because pop quizzes can happen which are open notes and she\'s caring a real darling;
Professor espana honestly tries to help everyone, she gives a lot of opportunities of extra credit and she cares about her students! Take her, it will be the best thing you\'ve ever done. Honestly make sure you study she will help you but you must try.;
She is awesome. She actually cares about her students. Her Exams are not hard and she offer so much extra credit its almost impossible to not pass. Easy A for sure TAKE HER;
This class is really easy does require access code for hw;
This was the easiest class ever ! she is the sweetest and she is soooooo nice.;
She\'s absolutley amazing!;
Easy A. So easy I didn\'t learn much. Participate and get an A.;
her lecture is really boring, she use a lot of boring video, long long time ago information. she offer a lot extra credit, if you did them you will get a good grade. it is hard to learning something through her lecture.;
Her online Psych 25 class was the easiest class I\'ve ever taken! Her quizzes aren\'t timed and you have all semester for homework assignments. Definitely recommend this class if you are working full time and don\'t really have time for homework.;
If you\'re trying to just finish your GE Classes & get easy A I would def take Professor Fitzpatrick, but if you actually want to learn psychology i would prob take someone else. Anyways, I took this course online and it was super easy, saved me lots of time. quizzes are untimed and you just have to keep up with the weekly forums . Shes so awesome!!;
Several small papers required and a final 5 page APA style research paper. Her exams cover a lot of material but she works with you to get a better grade.;
She took over the 2nd half of my socialpsych class. I had her for intro to psych and it was a waste of time. Her classes are why millenials think they\'re owed something. Write all your answers on her allowed cheat sheets and do assignments and you get an A+. If felt like an insult to the students who actually want to be challenged and EARN grades.;
Took Dr. Knight for Creative Writing and was very pleased. The woman is absolutely hilarious. She was a nurse and a police officer before she was a professor, so her stories go from 0-100 real quick. You write 4 original pieces in various genres and you\'re done. 10/10 would recommend.;
Damen was by far my favorite professor this semester! He is very enthusiastic about his subject matter, and SO funny. He makes learning history very interesting! He doesn\'t put grades on canvas, but if you do all writing assignments and pass all tests, you\'ll have an A. All test material is bold words on online textbook. Great teacher, great class!;
I absolutely love this man. His theater background makes his history lectures extremely entertaining and you will have several good laughs. He doesn\'t require you buy a textbook which is fantastic and you don\'t get points taken away you only add on. Only downside is he doesn\'t use canvas. Take this class! You will learn so much.;
irresponsible, the answer of exam may be wrong, you need to check very carefully after you are graded, otherwise you will easily get a low score, since it is graded based on a wrong answer!! He is very irrespective to students, the standard for project grade is very unclear, if you argue with him he will satire you and let you shut up!;
Dr. Bakker is as good of a chemistry teacher as it gets honestly. He uploads class lectures and does a great job explaining the math side of the class, which is normally where chemistry teachers struggle. Alot of people have dropped or have bad grades but this isnt an easy class but if you put in effort you will do fine. highly recommend;
Agree, you must read because she asks questions on the test about information not in the lecture. But she also asks about information in the lecture material. Interesting class. I learned a lot. Attendance not mandatory but you can get rewarded for good attendance.;
Theres not really much to say about her besides she is an amazing teacher. She loves what she does and when she starts to get in to it you can see her eyes light up. She is incredibly sweet, and will help you if you fall behind. Tests and quizzes are open book, and the semester project is BIG! but worth it in the end.;
I hated math until I took Dr. Neal\'s Calc I class. Then I took his Calc II and he convinced me to be a math major. I\'m extremely grateful to Dr. Neal for making me feel so confident in myself. He\'s very caring and notices when something is wrong with a student.;
This class was hard for me, but I haven\'t been in school or used most of the material covered in real life in 20 years. She was very helpful & was always able to explain how to do the problems when I got stuck. There is a bunch of homework & tests weigh for 70% of your grade. As long as you do the homework you should\'t have any problems with tests.;
She is at UWM. I have taken her 3 non language classes Attendance is important in her class, tho with a valid reason you can miss some, you will have an assinment every week, a quiz in some classes every week and papers and exams. Its not an easy A but if you do the work, participate, you should get an A. She\'s an awesome teacher;
Amazing professor. My favorite professor at BA and main campus. Super friendly and extremely encouraging. Easy A. Uses real life experiences in her discussions. Everyone is always involved in discusssion which makes this class so fun to go to. She cancels class frequently and cuts class short which sucks because I love this class so much.;
She is very kind so it is really easy to talk to her about things that are unclear, she uses areas of her work to help explain certain topics better. Although it is easy to get an A in her class its just as easy to get an F if you dont show up or do the work.;
She is mainly interested in male students and seems to flirt and make advances at men.;
Super good professor! I really loved what he taught and how passionate he was about it. He\'s retired now, but I\'m leaving a review out of pure gratitude. He rocks!;
Good class, as long as you show up and pay attention you\'ll pass. If you\'re struggling just attend SL sessions and its almost impossible to fail.;
Great instructor! Can be intimidating at first, but he just gets really excited about programming. Really helpful for new programmer at explaining concepts in plain english.;
Mike is a great teacher to have for intro to programming. I had zero programming experience going into the class, but his teaching made it easier for me. When he is explaining topics and theory he really makes sure what he is saying is clear. The class is known for being hard, which is why easiness is 3, but if you go to class and work you\'ll do ok;
Very funny personality, talks like he doesn\'t care but as he get\'s more excited he sounds more angry, which makes learning programming really funny. If you are new to programming take his class! If you already know how to program TAKE HIS CLASS because if you finish the assignments you get guaranteed 80%, rest is the tests.;
Honestly one of the best classes I took. He divides the semester into three major portions and his exams are only on what the material that was covered previously. He does give a cumulative, but its not a regular cumulative. He lets you decide what you would like to discuss out of the topics that were covered throughout the semester. Best teacher!!;
KWAG is amazing, one of the best classes. Go to class and pay attention and you will definitely easily get an A. Tells literally everything that\'s going to be on the midterm and finals;
It\'s a 2.5 hour class that meets once a week. It can seem long at first but TAKE HIM IF YOU CAN. I simply loved him and his classes. They were always a nice break from the heavy course work of my major. He requires nothing except to engage in class when you\'re there. Attendance was never required but everyone usually showed up because we loved him;
Just wow. I wish that I could take his class for the rest of my college career. We explored campus, talked about everything, and you really get to bond with everyone in class. If you show up you get an A+ b/c he wants to inspire you to get what YOU want out of the class, which makes most people actually care about the assignments. TAKE THIS CLASS!;
Lecture are incredibly long and boring;
never attend and you will receive an A. Easiest professor I have ever taken, and one of the kindest.;
Best Prof Ive ever had.;
I took this 4wk class online. There is a lot of reading from the textbook and PowerPoint lectures. Tests are in the form of 2 essays and you have to know your stuff to get a good grade. He gives detailed feedback which is helpful. And offers weekly extra credit. This class is not an easy A but he is a good professor and I learned a ton!;
Extremely chill. 2 weekly assignments, one in class, one for homework. He tells cheesy jokes every class and is super cool. It is a credit/no credit class and he grades mostly off of participation (completion of assignments). Very easy class with only a little bit of experience with excel.;
Fun class, easy teacher and he\'s always smiling. Just show up do the assignment for the day and get an A! Joke of the day is the best;
Go to class! Mike is very understanding so if you have conflicting responsibilities, talk to him. Takes late work. You can do assignments ahead of time and only show up to class for 15 minutes to get it checked. Encourages talking in class. Assignment grades based on whether you do them or not, not correctness. Allows internet usage/notes on exam.;
He is super caring and actually wants everyone to pass. Let\'s you work through the excel assignments as you need to at your own pace. the class is kind of set in a way that the assignments are online and you kinda just sit in class and work on them. He has like little sheets you turn in as proof of doing the work.;
He\'s a great guy and a great prof! Just go to class and you\'ll ass. 1 in class, 1 homework assignment every week. Time consuming but easy. Helps you learn a lot about excel in a way that will actually help you in the real world. I can\'t stress enough to take him.;
His class is fail proof! As long as you turn in all the excel assignments before the final you will be able to get full credit for them. That means you probably don\'t have to show up for the class. His assignments are very detailed which are meant to help you out. He tells a lot of jokes and is very sweet. Only a 10-week course!;
Mike is the best, amazing teacher great guy so funny, overall the best man out there.;
Prof Splane is the cutest professor ever. He really cares about you learning. He created all his assignments himself, and really wants students to get a good understanding so they have the most potential when they get out of college. Loved his class :-);
Very unique class format, as we do the talking instead of him. It\'s more of us self-learning, with Splane as the one overseeing things. Big perk about this course is that the textbook is online, so it\'s practically clear cut. Mac users will have slight issues, but it can be worked around. If Mike\'s available to teach, then take his class!;
Doesn\'t give you enough time to do the write-up. I had only two days and I had to contend with a physics write-up as well. The labs take three hours and the lab itself three hours which is a little bit long.;
I agree that there are too many formal lab papers give this is just the laboratory component of one five courses that any student is dealing with;
I believe that the Chem labs at Uvic are designed too much as busy work and do not encourage the use of one\'s brain. The labs are laborious but nothing is learned.;
I spend to much time doing the lab whcih is not co-related to the course and teaches you nothing. Lots and lots of formal write-ups at this school;
I would recommend considering applying to UBC instead of UVic,. Their courses are much more balanced than Uvic which is more technical .. like a trades program.;
My first ever TA at university. She really goes hard on you, ESPECIALLY on safety, but it\'s because this is your first chemistry lab and if you don\'t get it down now, you\'ll get hurt later on and she does not want that AT ALL. Nice sometimes... sometimes not, really hit or miss. Switch if you can. Future labs will be better if you continue chem;
Not a good program at all too much busy work;
THe laboratory part of this course takes too much time in general. At other schools there are less full write ups which allows students to focus more on the lecture course;
Too many formal papers not a good instituion. If you quailfy to attend UBC make sure you go there;
What a funny guy yet such a horrible professor. All he does is draw little figures and mumble. Tests and final are take home. Doesn\'t teach. All he care about is project project project. Worst part is he teaches 4 major classes and he is only professor for both of them.;
"Heywood is an absurdly easy prof, his attitude is ""your grade is what matters, not how you get it"", so all the tests are online, you can do them in groups, the quizzes have exact questions a few days ahead of time online, etc. That said, he\'s funny, smart, and not hard to listen to in lecture. And he\'s got an epic beard. Total badass";
I miss Dr. Nina so much. I am so honored to have sung under her.;
Professor Chase is passionate about physics, which can be seen by her marked enthusiasm during lecture. She does a great job of explaining different concepts. As someone who has always dreaded physics since high school, Professor Chase\'s lectures made physics bearable, and in some cases, even fun.;
I took this class online. It consisted of weekly forums, a few tests, and one paper. I liked that the forum questions were easy to discuss and based on your own personal opinions/experiences. The tests were timed, so it was necessary to study in advance in order to not run out of time. The class was really easy for me.;
Amazing teacher and extremely helpful. Some say she is tough but thats not true. Just attend class and dont be an idiot and youll do fine. Best teacher ever!;
Owen is a really fun guy. Just make sure you keep up with your homework and STUDY for the tests and you will be in good shape.;
This is the best and by far the most inspirational professor I have ever had the pleasure to take. If you truly care about science you will love this class and this professor. If you don\'t care and think it is ridiculous that a professor makes you study, after taking this class you will either shape up or probably drop out of college. Best ever!;
Love Dr. Jackson, if you need to take 301, take it with her! GREAT TEACHER!;
Good teacher.;
BEST COLLEGE ALGEBRA TEACHER ON CAMPUS !! Math was my worst subject, but her teaching techniques are amazing and will help you better understand the math. Come to class, do your homework, and the extra credit and you will pass the class. I left this class with an A !!;
BEST MATH TEACHER EVER! Come to class, do the work and its really no way to fail. I wish she taught every math there was lol. I would take her class again & again.;
Best teacher ever! Posts her class notes on icollege which helped out when studying for final. Gave out extra credit. If you need help she will tutor you in her office after class. I highly recommend her!;
Very great professor. I had her for two classes and she mentored me for my student teaching. Yes, she does get off topic but she has great stories and so much knowledge regarding special needs students. Her class required writing of reflections for each class.;
Best professor at Queen\'s. Hands down.;
DDHT 459 was the best class I\'ve ever taken. I enjoyed him in 218 as well.;
Jazz History was an awesome class! You don\'t need to know anything about music in order to get an A. He makes the class very interesting by bring his saxophone and allowing you to hear the differences between different types of Jazz. He only grades you on quizzes but he goes over every question the class before! Love this class and Paul!;
No Comments;
Lectures are long but he is so passionate about his subject! Dr. Haynie is such a kind person and he LOVES what he does. Test are easy and he will give you extra credit if you don\'t miss any class.;
Fantastic Professor. Easy to understand and always lets lecture out early. Never assigns homework or quizzes so all your grades come from tests. Such a great teacher that you\'re always prepared for the test.;
I am an international student. Dr. Pecorino is the most responsible professor I met in UA. His class is easy to understand so that I rarely read textbook after class. The class and homework is much helpful for tests. He is a very kind person. I really appreciate for his help.;
Had her for internal audit and thoroughly enjoyed the class and her teaching style. The exams and group project count for the majority of your grade, so don\'t take those lightly. She provides handouts for her lectures, and if you study those you\'ll be totally prepared for the exams.;
"Welp, I had this guy for tutor and surprisingly the words ""Never judge a book by its cover"" comes to mind. Although the tattoos and and mean face may deter you from talking to him, he is actually one of the rare individuals who will talk to students as equals and also JOKES around. Took him in Mr Li\'s, and Peter if you\'re reading this. HOLD IT, PJ";
Legit wizard. People find comp 302 hard because it\'s quite foreign but Prakash is a wizard at teaching this stuff. Going to his class was an actual treat, I\'ll take any class that he\'s teaching. About half the class was done the final within an hour.;
Very easy class. Don\'t skip class + understand A.;
Very good professor. Class is fun and grades very fairly.;
Very interesting and FUN class. I learned so much from him. You will have to write a lot of research papers, but you will gain so much knowledge from each of them. He is very fair with grading. I would take his class again!;
Professor Hall is very nice and helpful, but her class can get boring at times. All the homework is on the syllabus and usually it\'s due once every other week. When homework is due you have a quiz. Sometimes she gets confusing, but as long as you keep up with the work you\'ll get a B.. will have to work a little bit for an A.;
Terrible professor. Does not know how to teach. Would not recommend taking her unless math is your strength. If you\'ve taken calculus before its very easy but still rough to sit through.;
312 students should complain about the material, not the teacher. this guy was really great in machine vision- great sense of humor and definitely one of the top 5 lecturers in the cs dept;
Amazing professor that she explain very well and spend whole class time that mean she don\'t want to waste any minute.;
I feel that she really knows what she is talking about, and therefore manages to explain the subjects very well. She is helpful and makes sure that everybody understands the topic, yet one does not feel stressed or pushed.;
Listen to lectures. Do the homework. Read the book. She gives good feedback and will clarify any questions asked.;
12 (five question) MC quizzes, 12 (SUPER EASY) lab reports, 1 (10 question) MC midtermessay portion, 1 (10 question) MC finalessay portion. Google MC questions exactly, I found all the answers. I BS\'d labs (I don\'t think he even read them) and got perfects. I finished everything in 2 weeks, got a 99%. I didn\'t learn anything but hey I got an A+;
50% of our grade participation was given by attending class 10% was awarded for doing in-class readings and small projects, in which he would rarely assign! Quizzes are easy, online, and 20% of our grade. Midterm and final are 20% of the grade & are also online tests you take at home. If you can\'t get an A in this class, you\'re sad. Lol;
Awesome course and I am very glad I took it. If you are decided on him and another teacher TAKE HIM. This is a perfect GE course for life science if you are not a science major. There are about 10 quizzes (10 Q\'s) , 1 discussion, 1 current event assignment, a midterm (50 Q\'s) and a final (100 Q\'s). It sounds like a lot but it really isn\'t!;
I\'m an Economics major, so I was a little wary of taking Biology without proper preparation. However, I passed this class with an A, and with flying colors! Would recommend to all my friends.;
Just take it, trust me!;
Professor Warwick is amazing. He is funny and SUPER UNDERSTANDING. One time I got an answer wrong on a quiz and I gave him an explanation as to why I chose that specific answer, and he liked my explanation, and said that he would add that point back on. He is eager to help and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND taking his class. Wish I could take his class again.;
Professor Warwick is the best. I took his online course plus the lab and I actually learned a lot. He explains bio in a way (in his lab book) that normal people can comprehend. I HIGHLY recommend him. If you stay up to task you will get an A. He is VERY understanding and you can email him with suggestions/questions. BEST PROF EVER.;
Professor Warwick, is wonderful he grades fairly and he doesn\'t round your grade at all so don\'t expect a higher grade. However, I guess my case was different because I had an 89.89% after my final and he just gave me the A even though I didn\'t expect it :). He is very attentive to his email and will always respond in a timely manner!;
Dr. Wolf is the best teacher I have had this semester at PSC. His lectures are always so interesting. He encourages you to be bold, say what you feel, and have an opinion. He is so smart,funny and awesome. I will take him whenever I can in my other classes. Don\'t buy a book, the class is mostly just class discussions. ENJOY :);
I generally love all my teachers because I check them on here. This teacher, however, was extremely inappropriate. He made jokes about handicapped kids the first day. He spent at least two months looking at uncovered people, mostly women and even admitted to going to an adult site for some of his material. Won\'t take again.;
Reg is a great professor who is a master at working with students on their own terms. Where he lacks in organization and simplicity in his explanations he makes up for with his ability to make spontaneous connections to what you are interested in. He has an incredibly rich understanding of any reading material because he\'s read much of it 50 times.;
Don\'t do it unless you are familiar with Mac 1105. I\'m a straight A student & had a difficult time. Test seem to have nothing to do with what you\'ve studied. Don\'t normally rate professors unless necessary Nice person, but has a cocky, show off style of teaching. If you\'re not somewhat familiar with Mac 1105, DON\'T DO IT, YOU\'LL REGRET IT.;
He is a Mathematics man. Awesome. I had him for precal and will take him all of myh maths if I can;
I love math it\'s easily my favorite subject. This professor is very passionate and does an excellent job of explaining things. I\'m not a fan of liberal arts math because I hate word problems, he does an amazing job teaching and it was np for me. Attendance isn\'t mandatory but I took it as express and if you skip, you will easily fall behind.;
No comment. He is awesome. if not, you are not doing what you have to do for a math class. Do not complain you teacher.;
I had Dr. Bodek for my FYSE-War, Trauma, and Culture and he was an awesome teacher. He is really enthusiastic about the subject and has a lot of knowledge about it. He is a very easy grader as long as you follow the simple criteria. A lot of reading was necessary but no tests or finals. Great teacher, easy class. Would definitely recommend.;
Great Prof! Helped me through one of my toughest subjects, math. His explaining was alot better then the book he gave us.;
He is an awesome professor I ever have;
This professor is the best I have seen yet. He cares so much about you passing the class, that he will stop teaching just to make sure you get the problem correct. He makes mathematics simple and fun. There is no way you can leave this class confused or angry. He ALWAYS puts a smile on your face. Professors should learn his style of teaching.;
Amazing and funny lectures, has a very honest view of American Government which I enjoy. His quizzes and papers are super easy, I literally read / learned nothing and still got a 4.0. Make sure you turn stuff in, because if not he might not get back to you to turn in late work. Also, assignments are due at 5:00 PM, not 11:59!;
I had Olguin before for political science and loved his class. His classes are entertaining and very easy but the fact that he gets students involved and to actually think outside of the box is what gets our mind rolling. I like that he finds interesting ways to engage the students in projects, lectures, and different perspectives of the mind.;
Omg. BEST TEACHER IN NORTH SEATTLE COLLEGE. I wish every teacher would be like Rick!;
Rick is a wonderful professor--engaging, intellectual, and intelligent. He is passionate about political science and how it affects daily life. Lectures can be dramatic, amusing, and poignant. Although you probably won\'t need to take notes (work is minimal), I ended up writing down many inspirational things he said. Awesome class and teacher!;
Take him for PS. He says F word a lot, but everyone likes it. His lectures are inspirational, you\'ll never get bored listen to him. He assumes that students know everything about the US government, and he expects you to know a lot! I didn\'t know a thing, so ended up dropping the class. But definitely come back for those great lectures when im ready;
She is great. A little bit boring, but makes sure everyone gets everything. I guarantee after this class you will understand all you didn\'t understand before. Gives a lot of homework, but you don\'t have to turn it in. However, it helps a lot to do homework. Take her if you want to know math;
She is the best professor I had to finally help me understand math. I love her teaching style. she doesn\'t just tell you how to do the problem but explains why something is for what it is. the thing with math is there are sometimes more than one way to do a problem but she tells you her way and explains it well.;
She\'s amazing! I took an express 3 week course for M2 that I was nervous about since math isn\'t one of my strong suites. But prof Yarmish goes slow and makes everything crystal clear. Very patient and she truly wants all her students not just to pass, but to understand the material for future math courses you may need to take.;
Great teacher! The Professor hands you an A, but it\'s up to you to go and get it. You have to attend for the quizzes which are basically completion grades, and the two major tests are all open book online. If you care about your grade, you\'ll get your A. I also learned a bit as well. Opens many ways to earn extra bonuses credits. 1 LOWEST GRADE DRO;
NO BOOK REQUIRED. Prof. is more than willing to meet with you if you should need help. The lectures are amazing and Prof. is a very passionate speaker. Open many ways to earn extra credits;
Prof\'s amazing. I\'ve had this prof. for 2 classes now and they\'re wonderful, clear-cut, and pretty easy if you put in the work. There\'s 2 exams, 1 final, and 1 paper. If you get a grade that you\'re happy with on the first 2 exams, you don\'t have to take the final OR take the final and it will replace your lowest test grade. Awesome Prof.;
The coolest and funniest teacher out there. Don\'t question this, just take any of this classes. You won\'t want to miss them. And this professor is pretty adorable. 2 EXAMS . 1 LOWEST GRADE DROP. UNDERSTANDS THE NEED OF STUDENTS. EXTRA BONUSES CREDITS, YALL @UTD;
THERE ARE 2 TWO EXAMS . ONE LOWEST GRADE DROP. THE PROFESSOR OPENS MANY WAYS TO EARN EXTRA BONUSES CREDITS.;
This PROF.\'s amazing. I\'ve had PROF for 2 classes now and they\'re wonderful, clear-cut, and pretty easy if you put in the work. There are 2 exams, and 1 paper. If you get a grade that you\'re happy with on the first 2 exams, you don\'t have to take the final and it will replace your lowest test grade. OPEN MANY WAYS TO EARN EXTRA CREDITS. Awesome pro;
Very likable professor . seems to really enjoy teaching students. The reviews for the test are extensive and descriptive.;
He is the worst teacher I\'ve ever had. He is very rude and doesn\'t care about the students.;
Best professor at DePaul. This professor really cares about his students. He gives a couple of essays for the quarter but makes it really easy to pass. Let\'s you redo any assignment until you receive full credit. I enjoyed every minute of this class and it was a night class. So happy I took him.;
I dont understand the negative comments, no midterm no finals just a short reading everyday and short writing assignment. Easiest A you will ever get in college trust me;
Panzarella has the weirdest grading system and his lectures are long, boring, and irrelevant. A small writing assignment is due everyday but it is so easy. Although he is not the best teacher, this class is an easy A.;
The class was mostly discussion and lecture based. The topics were fairly interesting, and he made handouts of all the information we needed to know. Quiz and exam questions come straight from his handouts. He\'s not a very tough grader, and he\'s not the most interesting professor either, but the class was very easy.;
I\'m one of her creative writing students. I love Roberta. She\'s smart, funny, and sweet and understanding. I\'m not in love with the class, always. It\'s not her fault, it\'s the class. The talent level varies wildly, and I feel like we focus on the poor writers significantly more. I\'d like a higher level of talent in the class.;
DO NOT take this class if you don\'t want to waste your time. Spending 15 minutes out of a 50 minute class writing on the whiteboard, saying NOTHING while writing, is a waste of everyones time. Learning everything from SI and TA\'s just causes more trouble, he doesn\'t grade anything only the TA\'s do.;
This class was the longest class of my life. Lectures are extremely long! He stands in front of a stand and reads the lectures to you the entire time. Go to the SI Sessions if they are available! I learned everything from the SI sessions. He gives 2 grades the entire semester :midterm and final both you must write during class like a test.;
He goes off topic and gets into politics. He is a very successful investor and a former Special Operations naval officer. He is an expert on making money. If you want to get technical on details then take other professors but if you want to talk business in general terms then this is the professor to take.;
Professor is super easy so just show up, get the midterm and final (both are take home), and you\'ll pass with an A. He gives one homework assignment that\'s due at the end of the semester, and it isn\'t too time consuming.;
While her assignments and readings were a ton of work and boring, overall I found her friendly. She does seem to single students out on the threaded discussions though which is lame, but she still seems to grade fair.;
I never met a teacher that truly cares for their students as much as her. She is always asking for feedback on how she is teaching and if she needs to go over something again. She teachers better than any teacher at Truman and she knows what she is talking about. People fail because they don\'t put in the work and don\'t tell her when they need help.;
"She tries her hardest to get every student an A. She gives bonus points. We had a 25% curve one time. There are only 4 test including the final. If you read the book, take notes in class, and go to her office hours, you\'ll get a HIGH ""A."" And I mean like 97% or 98%. She is always asking if we understand things and stops for questions every 5seconds";
If you are having issues with this class, drop out of the School of Journalism. This is as easy as it gets. Show up to class, pay the least bit of attention, and you\'ll get out with an A. The content is incredibly interesting, just listen. He won\'t spoon feed it to you, he expects you to learn, he\'s not gonna hold your hand. Great Prof.;
I had professor Fenton for College Algebra. She made all the concepts very clear and worked through problems in a very thorough manner. She always makes time for questions and will work with anyone who is having trouble with the material.;
Dr Geller was so organized! All mc questions were from text and short answers from lectures. YOu know what to expect and can study accordingly. Know your stuff and you\'ll do well! I got an A in her class. I actually looked forward to attending.;
Dr. Brown is one of the best professors I have ever had. This course truly feels like what you might expect for an elective -fun, simple, and engaging. All of the writing comes from your heart (no outside research is necessary). I had her for both Postmodernism and Modernism, but you don\'t need to take Modernism for Postmodernism. I recommend.;
Best teacher ever. Made math understanding;
She is so sweet and understanding!;
A great professor for a great class! If you do all the work and study sufficiently for the test, it\'s an easy A. Dr. Bergeson is really good and explaining things and making lecture interesting.;
He is one of the nicest and humble people I have ever met! He very helpful with papers, attentive to his students, and funny! Do the readings and show that you are working hard and you will get a good great.;
If you have ever thought about dropping out of school this class will make you want to follow through with it.;
Currently in her class and it\'s so easy! just pay attention to her notes, do the practice tests, poppers and quizzes and you should be fine.10% of your grade from your practice test is added to the exam grade. Also if you\'re happy with your grade after the 3 exams you don\'t have to take the final. She is very sassy and sarcastic but i find it funny;
Her class was an easy A. The only thing you really need to do is just study her test and you\'re good. She sometimes messes up but overall she\'s a great professor.;
Ms. Hafeez isn\'t a bad professor, but she\'s not going to spoon feed you. If you\'re good in math and have good study habits, I would say take her. If not, it\'s best to take someone else. She goes pretty fast so it can be hard to understand what\'s going on. I passed with an A but I studied my butt off. Her reviews help a ton for tests.;
This is a review for her WINTER MINI SESH STATS 2311 First of all, she\'s very engaging in her live lectures. She cares a lot about her students, often offering to meet w/ us at UH to help. Since this course is only a month long, it\'s reasonable that she goes at fast pace, so pay attention or self study a little. 3 Tests, quizzes, and poppers.;
Took this class for winter mini. I don\'t recommend her in terms of her notes since her notes are disorganize and lectures are pointless to attend. If you plan on taking mini, be prepare to work hard since this class. Test is like the practice exam, so do it! Try your best to do well on the first 2 exams since exams get harder. There was no final.;
Shane Bell was surprisingly cool. He cared about the class and his students, and he always wanted everyone to succeed. His classes were fun and engaging, and he did a lot of in-class activities that got everybody involved with the course material. If there was ever a problem, Shane was always willing to help in any way he could. Very awesome.;
Shane is a great teacher! He always makes sure everyone understands and is totally willing to help with problems, even if it means looking into it after hours for a student. His lessons are clear and leave you prepared to complete the labs and in class assessments.;
Shane is a stand up guy. If you show up to class and engage you won\'t fail. He always gives class time for labs and allows a cheat sheet for tests. Put in some effort and you should have no problem getting a good mark.;
He was a very tough grader, but graded very fairly to what you actually knew. I used the textbook quite a lot also to answer his questions. He has certain papers to write that you NEED the textbook for or else you might not get a good grade. But overall, he was a great professor and I am very glad I took him for psychology.;
I took Dr. Hardyway\'s online psychology course. He is a tough grader, and you must turn everything in on time! He does not respond to emails right away. However, if you email him, he will answer any questions or concerns you may have. You must participate in discussions or you will fail. This class is very fast paced, but interesting!!!;
Loved this class. I took it in High School and often find myself comparing him to professors I have now. He is so funny and lectures were interesting. We even took a field trip to a women\'s prison. Very helpful and knows how to entertain students.;
Excellent teacher;
He is very smart and has a great teaching style. He teaches about interesting things that you would want to learn about! He is awesome!;
His assignments were all discussion posts, which don\'t have many parameters. He assigns a book that is a great read, it hardly feels like work. If you do the work then you will get the grade. Be sure to request for your article that is due at the end of the class. You will know what I am talking about, but be sure to request for them in advance.;
I love Hupp as a professor! This is my second time taking him and i have zero complaints. The field study was super easy. Only 1 easy test, and paper that is really your reference letter for him to write. Take him for any class he offers, great professor!;
He is fine. Take this course with him if you just want to pass, but not to learn to love math. Lot\'s of sitting in class and watching him struggle with technology BUT he is trying to get everyone to pass. All midterms are take home. You will get an A if you show up and try a little.;
Excellent poet and critic. Enjoyed his East coast insights. Is married to a fabulous graphic artist and is proud of his family\'s accomplishments. He makes his classes relative to what is happening in the world at large. Very erudite and knows his stuff. Loved his class.;
Gives partial Credits, You have to work very hard to get an A and F Easily passable;
Good professor. Took him in the summer class. Exams are based on his reviews.;
I loved this class. Dr lape does give test but they\'re easy if you read the readings. I read half the readings and kept up on the weeklies she post which summarized each ready and writer. USE THE WEEKLIES FOR THE TEST!!!!! easy to pass if you can readwrite english.;
I took her online US Literature I course and it was pretty straight forward. Dr. Lape\'s class is well organized, she grades essays fast, and responds to email in a timely manner. There is a lot of reading (not too much though) but this is a literature course so it\'s to be expected.;
Professor Lape has been one of my favorite professors ever. I\'ve taken two courses with her and wish I could take more. She encourages discussion of different view points and is incredibly supportive. The best part is her feedback! Every paper I turn in is returned promptly (which is rare!) with a grade and in depth feedback throughout my paper.;
Prof. Sue is the best professor I have ever had. She is so willing to go out of her way to help students and make sure they succeed. You have to write 250 word papers each class, but they become pretty routine and are simple. She is very knowledge, but you have to come to class ready to discuss and listen. I would definitely recommend her!!;
Dr. Lindahl is great! I am not majoring in anything music-related, but took this class because I heard it was an easier WI. She doesn\'t even give that many writing assignments, and the ones that she does assign are easy. The homework is really simple and the exams aren\'t too bad either. Go to class because she does in-class assignments sometimes.;
I really liked her! She was very respectful to students and understood that not everyone would learn at the same pace. Very organized!!!! Loved the online quizzes that you could take until you reached 100%. Lots of Extra Credit opportunities. She really cared about music and teaching music to students who probably have never studied it yet.;
Organized professor, very nice lady, and very understanding. Easy A if you attend class and put forth the effort. Learned a lot I have never known before. Would recommend if you were to take the class.;
Professor Lindahl is a great professor, who does a good job at explaining the idea of music to non music majors. She gives you guided notes, and if you pay attention you will do good on the exam. She offers lots of extra credit, and gives you ample time to complete assignments.;
Susan is a great professor and offers a ton of extra credit. It is extremely hard to not get above an A- in this class. No attendance is taken, however, there are 12 quizzes throughout the semester. Most of the time you can use your notes, she provides you the answer, or gives you points for trying. This is a very easy class for a UP.;
Susan was a great professor. She gave many extra credit opportunities, and allowed everyone to pass with at least an A if effort was put in. Showing up to class is not mandatory, but is very helpful in order to receive a high grade. She is very passionate about music, but is also respectful to those that aren\'t.;
Mrs. Mulcahy was so easy, but the best part is I still learned in this class! Just do the assigments how she wants, have the book and the notes for the online tests, COME TO CLASS, and you will have no trouble making an A. Attendance is huge, and just try to understand what she\'s asking for on assignments. TURN IN EARLY WORK!! She\'s great!;
It\'s either her way or the highway. If it\'s her way you\'re fine and can be in her club. If you have a different oppinion, you\'d better invest in body armor because you will be attacked. But in her defense, I don\'t think she\'s aware that she does it. Doesn\'t change the fact that she does.;
Very understanding professor. I missed her greatly during winter term. I hope she and her family are doing well. She helps students greatly, and she is very approachable during office hours.;
"I had Dr. Evergates for ""Senior Seminar"". Simply put this man is excellent. He is so knowledgeable in his field and others, is always willing to help, and took our papers and made them into something amazing. He is one of the best the college has.";
Has a very thick accent, but all his notes and examples he puts on the board are clear and straight forward. Very useful for Math 60. Daily lectures help tremendously with the HW. DO the HW to help pass the quiz the next day. Quizzes are daily. He will go over anything people have trouble with. Grades on a curve.;
"Mr Hu would take time to explain the more subtle points of Calculus I. I was repeating this class for the third time with respectable grades previously. Mr Hu would make jokes about ""stupid math majors"". And the sci fi show Dr Who. Mr Hu had class study groups prior to tests/finals. I wish I had better study skills to retain learning I will review";
Professor Hu lectures in an understanding matter;
Took Mr. Hu\'s summer school course. He was awesome! Explains everything in detail. He is well organized and goes over things that way you definitely absorb the information. I would take him again!;
You will learn a lot from his class;
Get ready to step outside your comfort zone and open your mind to learn new ways of seeing things. He allows you to test out ideas and theories through writing. If you are a good writer on top of that, you will ace the class and enjoy it immensely. However, the minute you close your mind is the minute you have set yourself up to fail this class.;
Great professor, if you do the work and post on the discussion boards you will do just fine! He outlines clearly what is expected in papers and if you follow what he tells you to do not only will you get good grades but the papers are easy to write.;
He\'s very specific on his grading material and really goes into depth on what should be included in your papers to make page count and write good content. He\'s very approachable and has a lively attitude, loves his job. Only down side is he doesn\'t critique papers at all if you\'re already a good writer. Easy class and great prof overall.;
Dr. G is hilarious! He likes to tell personal stories which helps you remember the material. The lectures can get long and boring, but that\'s because the class is an hour and a half. There are only three exams total, all of which are online. There are also two projects. The only downfall to this is that you can\'t lose more than 13 points for an A;
Awesome Teacher. Learned a lot from her.;
I love Professor Laplaca. She\'s like a mother to her students. Extremely pleasant and genuinely wants you to succeed. The problem is that she gives you an extremely long time to finish each project which isn\'t how the real world is. Also, I\'ve seen people with bad projects still manage to get A\'s because she\'s a very easy grader.;
She\'s like the happy helpful mom-ish teacher in a film. Does everything she can to help each student individually, both with class projects and related outside projects. Wants you to succeed!;
Tina Laplaca is very great at what she does. She juggles a lot being both a professor and an advisor. She gives great advice and wants you to succeed in life. Her lectures are fun and informational because she shares both her knowledge and personal experiences. She is highly recommended you wont be disappointed.;
Great Professor! Really helped me out with every little detail of my speech and didn\'t seem to rest until we both knew it was the best I could do. Very great Professor and a very great man.;
He generously grades speeches even if they are bad and understands public speaking is hard. He wants you to succeed and was my first professor in college to see good in me. The tests are easy as long as you read the book. I\'ve learned so much in this class so if you take SPE101 be sure to take him!! Ask about extra credit I got 25 points added!;
Mr. B. is the best speech professor anywhere. I HATE public speaking, but Mr. B. made us feel comfortable and laid back. He grades on improvement, not by expectation, meaning if you do poorly on one speech, but try harder and do better on the next one, he will take that improvement into account and boost your grade. He just wants to see you try :);
Ask him a question, he\'ll always answer. He explains complex theories in ways you can understand, he\'s understanding if you\'re strugglingcan\'t turn something in on time. He\'s hilarious, and he\'s the best!;
He\'s very nice and tries to teach it well but he is so used to dealing with grad students that he often assumes everyone knows whats going on and doesnt explain it thoroughly for people who dont get it. The tests are not easy, you DO NEED TO STUDY hard for them. know how to do financial statements backwards and forwards.;
Listen folks, the guy has to teach 60+ uninterested students and he is obviously a tech nerd. I spent quite a bit of time talking to him outside of class and found him more than helpful and personable. If you want a good grade, do what it takes.;
ensemble rocked, he gave us music that was a challenge and really pushed us musically. Jazz history is a cake walk if you only hold a minor interest. Amazing musician for a stiff morman. Doc is awesome;
I WILL SAY THAT HE IS THE BEST TEACHER I HAVE EVR HAD SINCE I CAME TO THE UNITED STATES. HE IS VERY ATTENTIVE AND THOROUGH WITH HIS TEACHING. TO ADD TO IT ALL HE IS VERY CONSIDERATE.I THINK HE IS A REAL GEM AND HE HAS MADE ME A CHEMISTRY LOVER! GOOD JOB PROFESSOR! KEEP IT UP!;
"Tony is an amazing teacher! For those students who don\'t understand the ""hype"" it is because some of us just don\'t get Chemistry but he makes us feel like it comes naturally. I dropped another professor & tacked on extra miles to be in his class & would do it again! I REALLY hope he considers teaching Organic Chem!! TAKE HIS CLASS!";
Wonderful professor. Truly cared that you learn and his efforts show it.;
Tosha was the best professor I\'ve ever had bachelors and masters level included. She also makes a wonderful advisor. She\'s usually willing to take on new advisees;
Tracy is awesome. If you have the chance to take one of her classes you should. I also felt like i understood the content of the class and ended the course more knowledgeable. She doesnt make class stressful and she wants you to do well. Tracy is a good role model.;
Tressa is the kindest teacher in the department. She\'s an easy grader and is very patient with people who struggle. She is also just adorable in general. Such a kind-hearted person.;
best teacher ever!;
I have taken 2 classes with Trish and she is pretty amazing. If you have taken biology or chemistry before Health class should be easy A. gives a lot of extra credit and her assignments are so fun to do.;
I loved professor Root! I had her for body conditioning and she was so nice and amazing. The class works you, and make you feel like you\'ve had a good work out! Root really cares about her job, and her students. I would definitely take again.;
Ms. Mitchell is awesome! She is so nice and willing to help if needed. She makes her classes interesting and fun. I have taken 3 of her classes and I wish I could take more! The only time I have ever looked forward to going to school is when I was in her class.;
I think one of the pitfalls reviewers of Lair fell into was not going to see her or staying a few minutes after class to ask questions. She looked scary & set tough rules, but when talked to, she relaxed many of the rules & was very helpful. Her class is par for the course, its math & requires work out side of class to pass, o look for it.;
EXCELLENT PROFESSOR!!!!! ONLINE CLASS EASY A. WISH HE TAUGHT MORE CLASSES ONLINE.;
Still my favorite professor to date.;
calc 3 with him at first it was hard to understand him trust me you get used to his accent, give both online hw and hw he made up. test is heavily based off the problems he made so if you can solve them quick you\'ll Ace his class;
Dr. Vo is the sweetest old man! His lectures can be a little dull at times but they are incredibly informative and are indicative what his tests will be like. Gives study guides and practice tests for all tests including the final!;
Had for Calculus III. Sometimes can be difficult to understand, but if you sit towards the front you should get it. If I saw his name listed for another math course, I would take him again in a heartbeat;
He was pretty clear to understand, and WANTED everyone to succeed. He posted last years tests and answers in order to help us review. Even though he gave some of the hardest webassign homework the tests were cake walks. Not even kidding;
I have him for Calculus III. He would give 5 extra points on any tests and expected HW every Monday. His accent will get better when you are used to it and try to sit at the front. Very lenient on partial credits. He is quite funny sometime.;
Super nice guy who makes Calc much easier. The WebAssign homework is disproportionately harder than the exams--if you can do the homework, the exams will be a breeze, but they aren\'t too bad anyway. Go to class, review his lecture slides on Blackboard, do the homework, and know the study guides well, and you will make an A+. 1010 would recommend.;
Dr Thielen is a true gem at Pvcc! Took his interpersonal communication class and it was amazing. His lectures are interesting and he wants you to participate. He is very clear and appreciates his students\' hard work! Would defedentley take his class again!;
Dr. Thielen is awesome. He does such a good job at engaging the students in interpersonal comm. He gives you every opportunity to make up lost points with multiple extra credit options. If you don\'t do the work you won\'t pass but you will have ample time to do it and its very easy work. I would take this class again, thats how good it was.;
Dr. Thielen was extremely intelligent and provided us with all the materials required to pass the class. His lectures were also thought provoking and entertaining.;
I took this class as a hybrid class and really enjoyed it. The class consists mostly of reading through the teachers slide shows and writing down information on a paper you could use on tests, which took a lot of time but helped me really succeed in the class. The teacher was very nice also!;
Professor Thielen was awesome! He allows you to use your study guides on the tests, making them 100x easier. If you don\'t like purchasing textbooks find someone who can share theirs with you, you WILL need it! You might get some last minute cancellations and he allows you 3 unexcused absences but he makes class interesting enough. I recommend him!;
Seems intimidating at first, but just jokes around a lot. He tries his best to make boring topics interesting so you don\'t fall asleep. Read ahead before class because he likes giving pop quizzes, and a lot of the time the same questions come back on exams.;
This legend was the highlight of my first semester. He\'s loud, funny, and likes to pick on his students out of mutual fun. He literally says what\'s going to be on the tests. This class was extremely easy, just occasionally review;
He literally gives you everything you need to get an A. Technically, he even gives you the quizzes and exams. Just fill them out and study them and youre all good.;
He\'s a good professor. His lectures aren\'t to long or boring, he does group and solo activities so you aren\'t just sitting there listening to him talk. There wasn\'t a lot of reading from the textbook and he is a nice person. I would recommend his class because it\'s not boring, he isn\'t rude, and the material is interesting.;
Organized lectures, great prof, cares about students, best in A&M Commerce, don\'t complain, takes time with students;
Professor Masten was excellent this semester! He will work with you and has the grades posted quickly!;
No Comments;
a wonderful professor;
No sympathy for anyone who struggles in this class. Prof. Chung gives review guides and his exams are quite similar to his exams. Even if you\'re not a finance major, this class isn\'t difficult and he is a good prof. The material isn\'t challenging and really it is an important course. Make sure you attend class because the powerpoints are blank;
Professor Chung is a great teacher! Sometimes, he copies and pastes HW questions directly from the textbook onto the exams, and he usually tells the class beforehand what kind of questions there\'ll be. Be prepared for free response questions along with multiple choice & T/F. Overall, if you study hard, you\'ll get an A.;
At first, she seems like she is going to be easy and lax, but as the semester rolls, she gets harder and harder! She expects everyone to be english scholars, and on my first essay, she gave me an F! And I take my time on my essays. If you think getting on her good side will help you, it won\'t!;
Yasmin is an ANGEL, hands down the best professor at Penn State. She\'s a delightful professor and really cares for her students. I went into this class terrified because i knew no Spanish whats so ever, she really helps you get through the class. She\'s helpful and humorous, her class isn\'t really boring at all. She\'s over all an outstanding person.;
Dr. Kim Park is my absolute favorite professor. She\'s funny, makes the class super interesting, she\'s very helpful and she makes sure that you\'ll be able to understand the materials and pass the class. Having her as my professor was such an honor. Lectures are fun, make sure you show up on time and don\'t miss class you\'ll do great. no textbook use.;
Like a normal college professor, your grade depends solely on quizzes and tests but don\'t worry, she\'ll probably curve 2 of them. The book is helpful if you\'re new to Stats especially if you want an A. But she doesn\'t collect hw. Calculator is also very helpful since you can just calculate the answers on it for tests and she lets you. Saved me tbh;
Tenger is my favorite. She is very accessible outside of class and genuinely wants you to succeed not just in her class, but in life. She is a pretty easy grader if you do what she wants (she gives tons of handouts with exactly what she wants you to improve on). She\'s actually a really nice person, though she may seem intimidating at first.;
Ms. Lester helped me test out of learning support classes, through the Summer Bridge program. She\'s a very nice lady and a very clear teacher. She can come off as rude or condescending but, honestly I don\'t think she means too.;
Nicest professor I\'ve encountered. You\'ll pass the course if you turn in every assignment. Overall, I would recommend him to anyone and it\'s the easiest course I\'ve taken.;
The rumors are true - she is a very difficult woman. But if you need chem for your degree, you can\'t avoid her, she is the senior lab instruction for 1st yr labs (and the \'prof\' for 091 - though you have to teach yourself everything, its online). Be prepared, get your work in ON TIME and hope for the best, its not likely she\'ll have any grace :/;
Incredible professor and human being. If you get a chance to take a class of his while at the College, do it! You won\'t regret it!;
Was not a good teacher;
go to his clsss equal to learn by yourself....;
Wouldnt retake this class with him. Hes good at teachin but for some reason some of the concepts were presented too difficult to remember throughout the course. He does allow cheat sheets for exams but make them quick to understand b. c it can slow you down. Make sure cheat sheets have examples of steps for specific problems rather than definitions;
Best and most helpful professor I\'ve had at Millersville. Would not recommend skipping any lectures. But she is very useful at office hours and responds to emails quickly. I think the tests are fair and she prepares you for them in lectures. Plus homeworks are very easy and are good grade boosters;
Dr. Miller is awesome! I hated chemistry in high school and after taking her class I don\'t hate Chem (as much). She is so nice and willing to help if you ask her! Definitely take her if u need Chem 103. The class wasn\'t that hard. Just make sure you stay on top of the work. Homework on D2l is due every week and test are frequent, not too hard.;
Dr. Miller is awesome, but her class is pretty hard. You won\'t understand all of the material from just the lectures/hw because it\'s so difficult. It\'s worth taking a half hour every other night to read the book - it\'s what I did and I came out with a B. Also, take advantage of her office hours. She explains things better 1 on 1.;
Exams are open-notes and open-internet. Projects are relatively straightforward, but small mistakes will lose majority credit - however resubmissions are allowed. If you want a chance at an A, you need to go to him with well thoughout questions so you dont need to resubmit. Use his example code as the starting point for all projects.;
No Comments;
"The worst! Anything that contradicts his argument he dismisses as ""it doesn\'t matter cause it\'s just comics"" THEN WHY ARE YOU TEACHING A COURSE ON THEM? In one class a girl called him out on taking a quote out of context, his response: ""I know but it\'s so much more delicious this way."" Great reading list but that\'s all. AVOID HIM LIKE THE PLAGUE!!";
Great class, great professor! Gel and the class itself is difficult but if you tough it out you will not only plass but develop useful skills as a dancer.;
good teacher. very helpful. if she herself is unclear about something she will check it out.;
Hey, I got a B, shes not that bad;
April is wonderful and is one of my favorite teachers. While some of her classes do require a good amount of work, she is generally very clear about what is expected and is extremely helpful. She makes most classes fun with her humor and positive attitude. I am sitting in on some of her classes even though i don\'t need to take them!;
He is a good guy. I loved him but I couldn\'t understand his accent. This problem bothered all foreigner students. He takes just two tests, midd term and final and review for tests 2or 3 sessions.;
He is fascinated by what he teaches and it actually inspired me to learn - not many teachers can do that. He really cares about his students. Asks us questions to make sure he is teaching the subject well enough. One of my favourite professors.;
While this subject can be a bit dry, all resources and lectures are posted online. It is an advanced course, with an applied version of SQL on the midterm and knowledge on terms with the final. Most of the class is structured so that while you have the resources, you learn how to actually apply the concepts.;
Took her for Crime, Media, Violence. Very charismatic and interesting. Funny dorky jokes propel the otherwise dull lectures. Very hard grader, doesn\'t really tell you what you did wrong/what to write on. Not the best, not the worst.;
Dr. Gfellner in her prime was apparently an amazing professor. I think she\'s gotten burnt out over the years and her class content reflects it. I passed because I bought the textbook and just took notes from it. I blocked her out during class and just did my own thing from the textbook. Her wardrobe is super jazzy though. Interesting to look at.;
Best one I have ever had. Speech is hard. You have to practice, regardless of the professor. But if you do what he says, each speech you write he checks on each person individually in class. If you do exactly what he says when he gives you individual help, and you practice, you will pass easy. Hes really smart so just do what he says.;
By far the worst teacher I had at RVC. Very condescending and often spoke to the students as if they were ignorant fools. There are many different speech teachers you can take for a better experience. Please stay away. There is no need to comment on the professional style of this professor. In my experience there was none.;
great prof, hotness irrelevant- here to learn and get degree- got a b worked hard but found his influence next qtr when had to do a speech in a class- i was actually comfortable doing a speech finally thanks to Prof Betts! Well worth the time and made it FUN!! GREAT PROF!! kudos to betts for doing a GREAT job and being PATIENT and KIND- TOugh,;
Professor Betts managed to make my first year of speech enjoyable rather than stressful and nerve-racking. He provided you with plenty of notice and instructions before each assigned speech. He also did not require anyone to memorize their speech;
Mr. Young provides a relaxed classroom environment. He is a funny and bright teacher. He gives an extra credit opportunity before each test, most of which were just writing paragraphs about math site recommendations. He puts all his effort into helping his class succeed. Could not recommend him more!;
Dr. Tjaden is such a dark spot among all the other great professors in the department. Every class was lecture read word for word from the textbook slides. Projects do not have clear criteria and require you talking to him a dozen times to actually understand them. Majorly disappointed in this class and professor.;
Tjaden is extremely smart and really knows his stuff, but this class is hard. There is a ton of individual work to be done. His lectures are helpful, but google honestly helped me way more than his lectures.;
Not at all helpful or clear about what he wants out of students. Worst professor I have had at this school.;
I really appreciate him opening the new door for me. I think it was decent amount of homework. I learned a lot from him. It was a little hard to catch up in his class and the assignments at first but his lecture/feedback always makes sense and logical. He spared a lot of his time every time I asked questions. I would take his class again.;
I wanted to become a better writer. This was the class to take. Mr. Potter did not waste my time and his process works.;
I\'m just okay at literature, but this class really helped me. The prof offered lots of comments on my work and plenty of resources. His lectures were smart and funny.;
Lots of reading, naturally as it is a Brit Lit class. Lots of papers, but most of them don\'t get graded until the end of semester. Meaning you don\'t get feedback on your work and what you should fix (from your professor) until its all said and done with. You do get feedback from your peers, this is mandatory. Overall, its a mostly enjoyable class.;
This dude is a boss. While there is a lot of writing it really isn\'t that bad and there is no test. Got a B in the class and didn\'t even use the book;
Bruce was wonderful. Not only did he teach me tons about meditation, stress management and prevention, he offered a wealth of other knowledge as well.;
I took his online class as an elective and regretted taking it by the end. The information is interesting but he is a tough grader. His tests were hard and very confusing.;
A brilliant Constitutional scholar that is not afraid to tackle the sensitive constitutional issues that confront our nation. He is very clear about is stance on the issues the Court, but he does not attempt to get you to adopt his views. He teaches the class in a fair, objective, and balanced manner. And he will go out of his way to help students.;
Conrad\'s class is very difficult because it\'s calculus. He doesn\'t do a great job at explaining the material during class, but if go to his office and ask for help he\'ll explain it much better. You don\'t have to show up to his class if you know calculus by heart. Don\'t let him intimidate you during the first couple of weeks either. He is a nice man;
He teaches directly from the book and is very boring. Makes many mistakes on the board and has to be corrected by students. 4-5 tests (90% of grade) and homework (10% of grade). Very difficult if you are not naturally good at math.;
Top 3 worst teachers I\'ve had at vol state, she is rude and reads from power points every class, all class. Accused me of plagerizing an opinionated paper like I was not capable of producing A material. WOULD NOT TAKE awful teacher.;
Camilo is one of the best professors, but he makes you work really hard. His classes tend to be demanding and time consuming outsidemail of the classroom. You will eat sleep and breatheven your work. And it can always be better.;
Great teacher, knows what she is talking about. Super nice and funny, explains things clearly.;
Prof. Shangraw will come at you like a raging hawk in the very beginning of each semester. Don\'t worry, he gets better as you get through the program and will eventually be a nice guy to know and learn from. He is very smart and loves BLUF, Bottom Line Up Front, and will tell you exactly what he wants for each assignment.;
This is a fun class. You have to work for an A and much to my group mate\'s disappointment, you have to do work no matter which part of the magazine you work on. But, you get something awesome to put on your resume.;
Boring instructor. All she did was lecture from the book and test. What I learned was strictly from reading. Questions are not welcome.;
What a guy. Abbas is a German genius mathematician with a slick accent. He\'s always cracking little jokes, bringing a little light to a very dull and stale topic. The class is stone cold. But that\'s not gonna change with a different prof. Plus lectures aren\'t mandatory because he posts his notes online. Go to recitation for the quizzes.;
The class is really tough due to lack of introductory material. It jumps you right into the nitty gritty. Her tests are really hard but if you do well on the assignments and projects you are sure to get at least a B;
TERRIBLE! I was overjoyed to get a B since I could barely stay awake the whole semester. Class consisted of 28-slide power points since the professor liked hearing herself talk. No class discussion. No encouragement. Strict with attendance and lateness. Not at all helpful for the final paper. Keri, the class writing tutor, is awful too. Just AVOID!;
enjoyed the class. enjoyed the professor wish every one read the material;
Good class. Liked the paper of my work even though it is not criminal justice. Take her;
interesting class;
liked the number of graded assignments;
Loved her and her class. She really cares if you get it:);
loved the professor extra credit helps;
no intellectual bullying..i liked this;
Thought this class was easy as long as you go to class. Just the paper and the presentation is your grades. She literally tells you exactly what to put in the paper if you go to class. Would\'ve gotten an A But I used an outline during the presentation;
She will make you wait outside the classroom if you are late for even a minute. If the assignment is 2 pages she wants 2 FULL pages.....no more and no less??? This is a vigorous course cuz you HAV to work in groups, its already tough for people like me who prefer solo but its whatevs. Getting an A? Dont think so, gettin that A is impossible.;
Wonderful professor! Taught me everything I needed to know to work as a forensic psychologist in a prison. He knows his material from working in the real world - a wonderful change from boring professors that only teach theory and research!One of the best, if not THE BEST professors I ever had.!;
3 papers, 4 quizes. Harsh paper grader- never felt like they were that bad. Go to office hours and let him read them before turning in. Quizes are all on reading but he gives you a heads up beforehand. Class was kinda boring unless he got off topic. Loved his accent though. Would recommend, but he is hard on papers.;
He is super helpful. Since its BIO, you know its going to be hard, but he makes sure you know what he expects of you. He tells you exactly what to study and how to get an A.;
He\'ll make you buy a book that you really should buy. I got it for $5 on Amazon. He tends to ramble and can be pretentious sometimes, and the three hour time slot is annoying, but overall I really liked this class. This convinced me to take more Phil classes. A quiz every class and a movie before all of them. I only wish it was earlier in the day.;
This professor is a joke. Aced all my tests, did every single homework assignment, but was given a 2.8 due to not being in class ever single day. If you want to take a class that reminds you of high school, then take her classes.;
Very strict at first but lightens up as the semester goes on. He\'s a tough but fair grader but gives good feedback to help you improve. He explains the readings and what he expects on the essays if you bother showing up to class. His lectures are dry but have great content.;
"She was a good instructor but really she didn\'t instruct anything. Everything was based off of your textbook and a ""lab website."" I had some issues arrive and she wasn\'t willing to work with me outside of one instance. The only reason I wouldn\'t take another one of her classes is because its not really my thing. I didn\'t take much away from it.";
He\'s a great guy but its hard to learn thermo from him. Goes off on too many tangents. Figured out after the 1st test that I could not go to class and still make the same grades. Im sure going to class would\'ve helped a little more but you\'re just as fine studying old tests. You get a note sheet every test. 4 tests with lowest dropped and a final.;
Beautiful, passionate, eloquent, amazing.;
She did not have grades uploaded on blackboard until the semester was over. She told us 2 weeks before school let out that we could make up assignments but at the time i had all 100s then i look on after the semester ends and shes added lots of grades that are like 40s and 60s.I would have done some of that make up work if those grades we uploaded;
Cynthia is a very good professor. She is very passionate in her work and knows her stuff. If you don\'t put in the work and don\'t study you will not do well in this class. She is the one of the best instructors at KVCC.;
Cynthia is an awesome instructor!! I am sad this will be my last class with her! I took her for both Cell Biology and Microbiology and really enjoyed her class! She is super smart and really cares about the students doing well, and wont let you give up!! Her lectures are interesting, and labs are so much fun!;
She is the sweetest professor, she is kind of difficult but if you listen and study you will be fine.;
You have to make sure that you attendant class throughout the entire 8 weeks. Lecture is something that you don\'t want to miss because almost every week you have a quiz due that\'s based off lecture. Taking notes is always the best so that you can go over your notes and be sure to pass your quiz. Didn\'t use the book as much so i wouldn\'t get it.;
Danny Fon is a great teacher. If you go see him in office hours, he will give you the answers to the homework. Final is not cumulative. I would recommend taking him.;
He is pretty funny but can be hard to understand due to his accent (he\'s Costa Rican). I think the biggest problem I had was that we would learn the material and have homework, then start learning the next topic, then have the test on the previous topic a week or two into the second one. It\'s more of the course\'s fault than his;
Mixed feelings. Excellent at teaching the material, learned tons, but tests are very specific and a total time crunch. Will to some extent be penalized if you do not think along the exact lines that he wants you to. I recommend if you want to learn, but not if you are concerned about your grade.;
Very, very funny guy whose jokes go over heads day in and out. Knowledgeable and will engage with you if you ask thoughtful questions. Can be snarky though, doesnt seem to love having to teach. Tests are VERY text dependant dont dare think you can rely on slides. If you are interested in material, this guy can really help you get it but no easy A;
Funny man. Tought me a lot. Good guy. Easy to talk to and work with.;
Not helpful at all. He left on two trips during the semester and did not care at all. Study edge and his class notes barely helped either.;
Great professor!!!! Open book midterm, 10 page paper, and open book final;
Dr. Gallaher is an unfair grader. He will not follow his grading key, he will not return assignments from your first semester until your second semester so if you end up with a C you will have no idea why. He also has made students feel stupid when they ask him question and has had to apologize it.;
O-Chem 2 is a difficult class. . Dr.G Focuses more on the mechanism of the reactions and few problems here and there. Although this may not be efficient for most students, he really wants you to succeed. He makes it possible to earn 100% on at least one of the 4 exams -we got lucky for 2 (this is huge!!). He wants you to try- you slack;

He wants to do you to try- you slack;
This guy likes to get deep. Tests are open note, sometimes open book, so it is SUPER important to take notes. If you miss a day you can always get the notes off of his power points or from a fellow student. Make sure you do ALL of the assignments ON TIME. That is where most of the grade is.;
Awful. Makes a very difficult subject even more difficult. Java isn\'t the easiest subject in the world to learn--and he makes it even more difficult. Some people are great teachers. Some are great business people. You need to know your strengths. Don\'t care if he\'s great in business. Lousy at teaching a difficult subject;
I\'m taken his next semester for TWO different classes. No test, and lot of movies. He is Great, lay back over all a very good teachers. You will not fail;
Alsop is the g.o.d. of bio at queens. he is very fair and a lot of fun to work with. i wish every professor had the enthusiasm of this guy.;
Great teacher and always ready to help you if you can put in efforts;
A weird class in my opinion. Was confused a lot of the time and not sure how all topics related to each other, but her class is set up pretty clearly. She gives reviews the class before the test and is pretty much exactly what\'s on it. The prompts are hard to grasp for papers, but I never got lower than an 87% on one. I\'d recommend still.;
Class structure is great honestly;
I loved professor O\'Shea. She was great! Her lectures could be a bit boring sometimes but she always tried to keep everyone engaged in class. She gives 4 essays and 3 tests and 1 non-cumulative final. The tests are easy, she gives a review, but the essays can be a bit difficult. She can be a tough grader on the essays, it\'s easy to get a B on them.;
THIS CLASS WAS BY THE FAR THE EASIEST CLASS I HAVE EVER TAKEN AT EKU. DR. HOLCOMB IS VERY NICE, A LITTLE WEIRD BUT YOU WILL LEARN TO LOVE HIM AND MAKE SURE YOU GO TO EVERY CLASS (NO CLASS ON FRIDAYS) AND DO YOUR WEB ASSIGNMENTS AND COMPLETE YOUR WELLNESS PROJECT AND THERES NO WAY YOU CAN GET ANYTHING LESS THAN A B!!!!;
He is a great prof his assignments are not always the clearest but is really willing to work with you he makes class fun I would recommend taking him for your English 201 class.;
Prof Harding is funny and personable. He grades a little tough but gives you the rubric before hand so you know what you\'re going to be graded on. He doesn\'t put almost any grades in BB until the very end of the semester so it\'s hard to know how you\'re doing in the class. He is a fun professor and tries to make things interesting.;
This class was alright, but sometimes he was rude to students in class. The papers were a challenge, and the take home exams were no breeze. I would not take him again.;
Awesome professor who cares about her students, she understands that everyone isn\'t comfortable speaking in front of people. Very tough grader though, only class i couldn\'t get an A in. Be prepared to work!!;
Professor Dilek is a great professor. She is very caring and always ready to help. She provides study guides and review sessions when possible. He has 4 mid term tests. She does offer extra credit that involves going on a field trip. I would definitely recommend her she is great. You won\'t regret taking her.;
this teacher is very nice but she is very hard to understand the whole class felt like a huge waste of time. i can truly say i didnt learn one thing knew from her. the class really felt like she let students teach more then she did. lots of test with very little extra points. also lots of random papers online you have to do. i would never pick her;
His teaching methods are not normal. He would yell at you and tell you that you did it wrong, but on the other hand he would gladly help you correct your issues and understand what you were doing wrong. He would even come in on Saturdays to help his students learn and make sure projects were done on time. Great prof and helps with real world sits;
Do Not take this professor. She is not specific on anything. She is NOT organized at all which causes you to be confused most of the time. She is a tough grader and only wants you to believe what she believes. Thanks to her bad organization skills, I now have four assignments due in one week as finals are approaching. Do Not take her.;
I dont like history classes, but I did like that she is very understanding and passionate for what she lectures. Students who take this course think that you need to know a lot about AAS, but this is a beginners course, which she does remind us multiple times throughout the semester that she does not expect us to be experts on the subject.;
I could imagine this class being difficult for those who struggle with math.;
This class is a complete waste of time;
I took almost everything that Branch taught @ Guilford College a few years ago. I thought that she was the most thought-provoking, engaging scholar. She was also very approachable and genuinely invested in the success of her students. She inspired and still inspires me to Go Deeper. Novels, articles, & other forms of research were our textbooks.;
she\'s so passionate about the course and it really shows which definitely helped me stop being bitter about having to take this to graduate. the paper really isn\'t that hard and the weekly quizzes make it easy to know where you stand in the course. I highly recommend her.;
Very professional and focused on her work. Keeps students best interests at heart and pushes them beyond their comfort zone in order to better then.;
Emily is one of the most energetic and outgoing professors I ever had, there never was a day I didn\'t want to not come to class I loved every minute of it, she truly is a blessing and a gifted teacher;
This class is SO MUCH READING, and Ruckh is not very clear about what he expects from you. The vagueness makes it impossible to get an A--unless he favors you, of course.;
I didn\'t have a very good experience with him. I took him online and he was not very helpful at all. No matter how many times I emailed him, he always treated me like my questions were dumb. I\'m a science major, so I took this class because I was required to. I tried to get help from everyone I could think of for his assignments but it never helped;
I struggled at first with Math 114 but quickly learned what she wanted. Do the homework twice (once a few days before the quiz and the night before, trust me it\'s worth it). The midterm & final questions are kind of odd. You get to use a sheet of notes on the midterms& finals. Overall, not a bad professor but not a great one.;
Professor Malitsky\'s lectures are read straight out of the textbook but she doesn\'t cover everything in the required textbook so, if you go to class, you don\'t need to read the textbook. I would suggest going to class because she does help with the online homework assignments. Not a bad professor, but her Polish accent takes a while to get used to.;
Professor Fox is extraordinarily knowledgeable. However, his lectures are invariably delivered at a snail\'s pace, in a very dry monotone.;
Professor Dogru is a great professor. She is foreign so she has a very slight accent and occasionally she will accidentally mess up some grammar while talking but she is extremely helpful and truly cares about her students;
Absolutely no structure to the class making it extremely difficult to know when or what to study. Must buy text book written by him and filled with spelling errors, excessive rambling and organized poorly. Do not recommend.;
His class is very entertaining and is easy. His classwork and homeworks are easy and he doesn\'t quiz you. He also tells you whats going to be on the test which is awesome but theres alot! He makes you write about three essays for each tests and there are also true false questions.;
Hes very rude and talks nonsense to the whole class. He gives out answers but changes the subject too much. I feel like I am not getting the proper learning I should be getting. Hes worse by far. I dont understand how hes an easy class of does not teach but talk useless information. I am trying to get a career here.;
This class is no doubt an easy A. You pay attention and do good on the tests your good.;
Very nice professor who is always clear on his material. Study the syllabus and take good notes and you\'ll pass the tests, but there\'s only 4. Can be an easy A if you put some effort in. Can be an easy F if you never show up or study for the tests.;
This was a mini-course taken for HU credit but it honestly felt like 2 hours of the Amrine show. We never had ANY discussion and he just talked for two hours straight. I don\'t know why I kept going. Then the one paper that the grade was based on had 0 criteria laid out. No examples or anything. I had no idea what I was doing and paid the price.;
Took the minicourse for intellectual breadth. It\'s a easy 1 credit 300 Level humanities, and I am a lazy Engineering student. He just kinda talks for 2 hours then asks you to write a paper at the end of the semester. I passed, so I can\'t complain;
Mr Pouncy believes no student deserves an A. This is his teaching philosophy. His stories are interesting. His teaching is good, but not good enough to produce students capable of A quality work. If you need an A to get into the nursing program or just for the sake of learning how to do high quality work, pick another teacher.;
Took him for Accounting 1 and got a B. It was a breeze despite having another class during that period. You just have to contain yourself and you can end up with an A or a B.;
Whoah, I just finished a 5 unit class in under 5 weeks! Give yourself enough time to finish all the assignments. Score high on those as well as the tests. I had some interaction with the professor, but really this is a class that you can do on your own. Took this class with Connect and had to buy an online code, that\'s the only downside.;
DO NOT miss lecture ... You\'ll fail the Lecture Exams & won\'t receive iClicker credit... STUDY for lab tests (Microsoft, Excel, Powerpoint) through Simnet... If you miss class you can learn the information from the text book, but it\'s not as easy to understand so I don\'t recommend it;
Easy class if you review lectures for exams(every other week), and word/excel tests are easy if you just practice online. Attendance wise, you just need 70% to have 100% and that is tracked by iClicker participation every lecture, so you can miss a few classes because the powerpoints are all posted online. Great teacher, easy class;
Glenn is a helpful professor who doesn\'t want you to fail. Makeup policies are good. You don\'t need the textbook but need the SIMnet pass which is pricey. Class is easy as long as you show up with the iClicker. Read his lectures before a test and you\'re good. Also, do the SIMnet tutorials, very helpful!;
I came into this class knowing nothing and had a complete lack of interest in anything to do with computers. Now I am going to minor in Computer Science! Glenn was amazing and makes things understandable for those with little to no knowledge of computers. Lecture quizzes are tough, but the labs are what really saved my grade.;
Lectures are long and boring. Class is easy if you are good with technology (word and excel). Definitely makes you work for your grade!;
This class is as easy as you want to make it. Do the simnet trainings and you will do fine on those tests. get the easy iclicker points. Hardest part is the lecture exams, but they are fine if you show up to class moderately. Funny guy. Satisfies a major business requirement as well.;
Make sure you show up to class or you will fail. He isn\'t always clear on what he\'s looking for on tests, so make sure you pay close attention and take notes. The way he grades is very un-organized so ask him frequently or he won\'t tell you but maybe once or twice. With the book you only need it for a list of definitions for one test ONLY. 4 tests;
A&P is an extremely hard class regardless of the teacher but Prof Mann was great. Not very enthusiastic but he tells you exactly what you need to know through his PowerPoints. It\'s all memorization. You definitely have to study your butt of, but as long as you do that you should do fine. NOTE CARDS ARE A MUST! Only used my book to study bones/musc;
Awesome professor! He is extremely helpful and clear on what he expects from students. Didn\'t need the book. All lecture tests are from his power points. Lab study guides are very direct and helpful. He is very understanding and treats students with respect. Wish he taught Micro! I recommend his hybrid class for sure!;
Dr. Mann is an awesome teacher! He knows the material inside and out. You know exactly what he expects on exams and where your grade stands at any point in the semester. He uses schematics to explain main points and online lectures give you a chance to review for exams. He is very helpful and an all around good person.;
Really wants his students to do well. Lectures are long and wordy but you will do well if you go to class.;
tough gradrer;
This guy is great! He provoked me to think about things in a way that was uncomfortable, sometimes I wanted to get up and walk out, but that is philosophy in demonstration. Some were put off by his wry sense of humor, but if you are smart enough to figure him out, he is actually hilarious.;
I love this professor. I\'m taking him again in the summer. Totally knowledgeable in his field, but he understands that students are not, and that is why we are in class to begin with. His tests are tough and you\'ll need to devote some study time to any class with him, but overall he\'s easy to learn from. A wealth of information. One of the best!;
Before I say anything else I liked Ida as a Human. Ida is the nurse that would\'ve administered Zyklon B to the Jews, but only if the APA formatting was correct. Ida is the definition of a bureaucrat. She wastes 1/4 of semester covering syllabus/student handbook/APA formatting. PON paper is about format, tests are MOSTLY power-point.;
Having Slusher\'s class (along with the other two pre-nursing courses) were a major wake up call for me. I was used to making A\'s and ended up making B\'s in all three of the courses. The tests are confusing, you basically have to choose the answer she\'d want you to. She grades the paper really strictly so make sure you take it to the LRC beforehand.;
You can tell from class that Dr. Slusher is definitely a good nurse and knows the information she is teaching. However, she is very tough to please in class. Her tests are the hardest out of the pre-nursing classes. All the answers can be right, but you have to pick the one that is the most right. You definitely have to work for your grade.;
He is an okay professor, he knows what he is talking about but he is pretty difficult. He grades speeches on the harsher side. It is not really easy for many people to speak in front of others and I feel like he forgets that. He always uses the way he speaks as an example but has been doing it for so long hes a pro while were still adjusting to it;
Olaye is awesome;
She tests more on the A&P than the word definitions, but she goes over everything and is pretty fair. She uses a high school grading system (93-100 A, 85-92 B, etc) and that sucks. Would have gotten an A if she used a regular grading system, but overall good teacher who will work with you if you have to miss a test or something.;
An exceptional and accomplished professor that brings education to reality. Great job!!!!;
Held amazing lectures, and let you know exactly what you need to do to pass the course, though he is a tough marker. The lecture material definitely had the potential to be boring, but Allard made everything interesting and fun!;
The first few lectures I was wowed with his lecturing ability. But this wore off as I realized he said the same thing over and over and over again. I also do not think that his course was well described in the description on line. The readings were horrible and most hard to understand. All he talks about: STORYTELLING. Every lecture. The whole time;
Tough class but as long as you go to class and do all the homework questions you should be fine. He was the most available professor to offer help with any questions I had at UTSA. Study sessions every Sunday afternoon and every day after class.;
Great professor! Taking him in the summer is more difficult to manage tho. Would recommend him for regular semesters.;
He is not that hard if you just want to pass. 6 quizzes are 85% of your grade, but they are only few questions each. He grades purely on the curve. His teaching style is to give you a solid understanding of the material which enables you to pass any test he throws at you. He has lectures on YouTube, which REALLY help. Very light workload.;
AWFUL;
This class about killed me. Seriously, this was an online class and there was no routine, she refused to answer questions, and she always tried to confuse students on the quizzes. You can listen to the lectures 20 times, do all the practice problems correctly, then get to the test and be like what the crap is she talking about.;
Very Rude. Treats you like a child because she thinks grad students are superior. Class isnt that hard but take another professor if possible.;
tough class, lots of things to remember, but not much different from any other class. She gives you a break by giving you LOTS of x-tra credit and make-ups. Really knows her stuff.;
Great teacher, and is straight foward. I have had several math professors at parkland. And he is the best i have had! Good amounts of homework, but not strenous. Quizzes and tests are very clear, and are similar to what YOU ARE ACTUALLY STUDYING IN CLASS!!!;
The class was easy if you attended and paid attention and if there wasn\'t anything you didn\'t understand he helped out as much as he could. Made class very fun and always interesting. Easily the best professor I\'ve had so far at SRU.;
Pretty condescending towards non-native English speakers. His essay corrections are often very unclear and difficult to learn from. Claims to be a generous grader but in reality is harsher, more nit-picky, and less forgiving grader. To be fair, he always offers private office hours to those who need it. I unfortunately did not benefit much frm thos;
If youre thinking of taking Gutliph, do it! For an online class, he is extremely helpful and interacts with his students. He grades fairly, doesn\'t overload with too much homework, and prepares for tests. He is super helpful and has good taste in music as well which makes him all the more awesome. Take him, you will not regret it one bit.;
Great professor. Very intelligent and you will learn a lot. If you put the time and effort into the class you will do well. He is always willing to talk and help you out. I would take his classes again.;
She was a wonderful teacher. I wasn\'t able to read music at all before the class but at the end of 182 I could read music pretty well. From this it shows that she is an wonderful teacher. Anyone will have a great time in her class. Just make sure you put your practice time in or she is going to know that you hadn\'t practiced.;
Will never take this class again. If you\'re not a die hard history lover, trust me, DON\'T TAKE THE CLASS. You\'ll regret it real quick.;
Ms. Yearwood overall a great teacher, she can be confusing with dates for assignments and projects, but overall she is very knowledgeable about the subject, if you just read the chapters you will do fine.;
She is a really good teacher and you can tell she cares about the students. You will have to work for your grade in her class. She wants us to succeed but she\'s not just going to give you what you don\'t earn. Her lectures are long & sometimes they make you want to sleep. She\'s very informative though.;
25 homework questions from each lecture. 150 homework questions every 4 weeks. Tests are 70 questions most of which are the exact homework questions. Some questions are easy & some extremely specific. All of this while doing a semester long group project. FML. Class definitely has its pros and cons. Expect that it will take a lot of time.;
Boring lectures, Really condescending with students, Test cover a lot of information and is hard to find even using the book,If you have the option take this course with another professor.;
Good class. Will learn more here than in most classes but if you hate speaking in class it might not be for you. But the class is defiantly not boring;
He is a great teacher, gives constructive criticism all the time. He uses a lot of repetition, which got pretty boring to me after half of the semester. He grades you based on your final portfolio mostly and daily sketches. We only used the book about two times. He is strict and does not like ppl who are constantly late &the nude models are cool!;
Very likely the hardest working and most dedicated instructor that I have seen in a while. Will push students to do their very best and works hard to make sure students have a good learning environment. Be warned, he is tough and will not take any BS. Come on time, come prepared, and work hard for your grade!;
"I couldn\'t stand her as a teacher. That said, her class helped me become a better writer. That helped me in college as well as my career. I owe her a big ""thank you"".";
Beneski is a very smart man and really knows his stuff about anatomy, but he is not the best at teaching it. He lectures very monotone and it can be hard to keep up with so I recommend recording the lectures because you need to know literally every little detail for the exams. You need to put at least 10 hours in a week if you want a good grade.;
Beneski is very monotone and the lectures are dry. You need to go to class and take good notes because he goes into much more detail just off the top of his head. In order to get a good grade you have to be able to apply the material in the test. Start to prepare for the test 2 weeks in advance. Its doable.;
He really knows what hes talking about but he isn\'t the best teacher. Lectures are very monotone and the only grades are exams and 2 homework\'s a month. He doesn\'t tell you about any deadlines, you are just expected to know when the tests are and when the homework\'s are due. His class does not co-inside with the lab at all!!;
John Burk is a great professor! I failed Business Calc the first time but after taking him I actually started understanding. He gives a good bit of homework but it all helps for the exams that he gives.;
Great teacher- funny, down to earth, made the class very enjoyable and relatable. He wrote the book himself which made it very useful!;
Be prepared to STUDY a lot.;
Dr. Curra is a great person. He really knows what he is talking about. Unfortunately, he will lecture from the start to the end of class without taking a break. There is so much information, and a lot of it is unclear. His tests are extremely hard. Don\'t take him if you are looking for an easy A.;
I took this class on summer 2015. Professor is so nice, he always helpfulness. But he cant give good grade, and I dont think is easy about his test. I just got grade B on this class, that so sad. You need buy his book cause have code with that book , his all test online.;
This guy was awesome. He would talk to himself at the board and always insult himself for doing something wrong. His class was great and for the first time I understood what the h**l precalc was about.;
Made class more enjoyable and made a rather complicated subject understandable. Has available office hours before class and is always willing to help. He is also one of the goofiest and funniest professors I\'ve had!;
You will not regret taking a class with him. I have always struggled with math and thought calc would be impossible for me, but he made it understandable. He\'s very funny, cares about students, and makes a lecture for a very boring subject interesting. The textbook for this class is VERY complicated, so don\'t expect to pass easily if you don\'t show;
He is not clear and his lectures make class go on forever! He puts his lectures online, so you don\'t have to go to class, but class helped a lot. I didn\'t really learn anyhting from him, it was mostly just the TAs.;
He\'s a smart and funny guy. He goes off topic here and there, but he covers all the information he needs. You will actually learn in his class. If you like history you\'ll like him. The class is pretty much just lecture with 3 midterms. It\'s not the easiest class that you\'ll ever take, but it\'s also a class made for freshmen.;
Professor Reed is a really cool dude. He really isn\'t as intimidating as you think. The class is based off of 3 tests that are essays. That may seem hard but it really isn\'t that bad (especially if you attend the TA sessions). I was an hour and a half late to our final and Reed let me take it with the full time in the testing center BLESSED.;
I am currently a junior student in his studio, and I could not be more happy of the fact that he is my clarinet professor. I was mediocre before I started my clarinet journey at WVU, and now I\'m at a point I never thought I could reach. Yes, he does have high standards and he can be harsh, but it is to push you to aim high and improve.;
He really hates doing examples in class and will not unless you force him to. Instead he focuses on theorems. Asking questions in class is a must. No calc or notes allowed on tests.;
I took her African American history class in USF. Dr. Richards is a great professor. She taught history in Afrocentric perspective. She cares about her students very much. Be aware of the pop quizzes. For midterm and final exams, if you put works on it and do what she asks you to do , you will definitely get a good grades.;
Nice person, not a nice professor.;
Terrible teacher. Avoid.;
Do NOT take this teacher if you want to learn spanish. She is extremely hard to understand and is horrible at teaching concepts. I barely made a B because I took spanish in high school i was just rusty. Also she is extremely boring and monotoned. I do not recommend her;
Prof. Campos is really nice. She will work with you if you miss class. Office hours and communicating with her helps. You need to pay attention and not skip class. Exams and papers are not to be taken lightly. I learned a lot from her. Whoever complains about her class is just lazy.;
These comments accurately describe the class. She does scream at the top of her lungs often, which is annoying considering my class starts at 830 am. She goes off topic way to often, talking about things that have no relevance to the class. Today we were supposed to review for the test, but we ran out of time and weren\'t able to.;
By far the worst teacher, I have had. Wish I paid more attention to her reviews. Majority are 100% accurate, save yourself the headache.;
I learned so much in this class, at first it was overwhelmingly, but she gives you linked learning to videos and her lecture notes with examples. I found it fascinating that I not only understood about the developing child and adolescence, but about myself. I loved the inspirational messages and reminders that she included in her announcements.;
GIVES QUIZZES EVERY CLASS AND PAY ATTENTION TO ALL THE SMALL DETAILS IN THE BOOKS.;
AWESOME!!!;
Great Teacher. Class will require some work but not too bad.;
Loves to hear herself talk. Will get extremely offended if you use your phone in class, and will threaten to take your phone. The amount of work you have to do on some assignments for the amount of points the assignment is worth is completely skewed. Would not recommend.;
The class itself isn\'t too bad. 10 cases, 3 exams (last exam is extremely card due to calculations), and one final project. The class would have been enjoyable if it wasn\'t for the stupid GA. The GA loves marking answers wrong & never gave anyone in the class a perfect score for a case/assignment.;

Mrs. Johnson is a wonderful teacher, one of the best I have ever had. She genuinely cares about the success of her students and wants them to do good. She is more than willing to help when a student needs extra help. She tries to teach each lesson several different ways because everyone learns differently. HIGHLY recommend this teacher!;
PROF MOORE WAS THE BEST MATH TEACHER IVE EVER HAD. IM NOT GOOD AT MATH AT ALL AND SHE ACTUALLY HELPED ME UNDERSTAND ALL OF THE MATERIAL. I RECOMMEND HER. SHES SO PASSIONATE ABOUT HER JOB.;
Seems to understand what he is doing, but is easily the worst teacher I\'ve had at communicating what he is talking about to students. His lack of proficiency in English can be a challenge at times, although accent is clear. Can be incredibly rude at times, calling out students for not knowing answers.;
Her lectures were incredibly specific and too advanced for an introductory class. She would wonder why no one was understand anything and the concepts were uninteresting in the way she presented them. She doesn\'t seem to care about the intro class at all. Is only in it for her own research.;
Extraordinarily smart, and knows his material. He\'s the department chair and rightfully so.;
just soso;
The lecture is hard, unclear.;
Class was fun but I didn\'t go. I didn\'t read or do anything. I was going to withdraw midterm but he told me if I committed hard to class he would help me with the work and maybe I could pass on a D. Worked my butt off and got a B at the end. Really really good guy because he cares about students and helps so much. Best professor ever.;
Exams are based on things discussed in lecture so you need to go to class. Papers are graded exceptionally tough, he doesn\'t bell curve but the average always tended around a C. Even if you make the improvements based on his comments, it won\'t mean you\'ll get a better grade because of how subjectively he marks.;
If you don\'t go to class you wont pass at all. YOU CANNOT MISS ONE CLASS. He leaves blanks in his power-points and you are only able to find the answers in class. At the end of the class he does not re-post the power-points with the missing words, so you are unable to study off of them if you miss a class. And there is no textbook to look at. DONT.;
Sadkowski is the worst professor I\'ve had at UNI. Sadkowski lacks organization, shows up late to class daily, is regularly not prepared, and fails to make this course interesting. He relies on the textbook to cover all of his material. Sadkowski teaches heavily through pointing at maps and listing European countries, dates, and leaders rapidly.;
WAY too much work for an LAC Humanities course. He\'s a great, funny guy, but this class was difficult and I went to every class and hardcore studied. The course guidebook helps IMMENSELY- it has study guides in it, but tests are still difficult. Make sure you read the books he assigns. The grading scale is SUPER lenient- I got a 75% which is a B.;
Attendance is absolutely mandatory. She does not put the power points online which kind of stinks. Her tests are hard, and require a lot of studying. Nice lady though.;
reeeeaal snippy;
He always went over the scheduled end time. If you didn\'t have word for word answers on the exam, you would not receive full credit. The subject was boring to begin with, and he made the class even more boring. Not very professional. Only plus, he never made you do busy work, everything had a purpose.;
"I absolutely loved this woman\'s class! She had such a huge impact on me and I\'m sure she doesn\'t even realize it! She is a wonderful teacher and she makes sure that the students make her do her job. ""Don\'t leave this class until you understand, I\'m here because of and for you!"" Wonderful professor I\'ve taken for 1301 & 1302. I would take her again!";
I took English 1301 and 1302 with Ms. Griffin during my freshman year. Her classes are not easy, but if you\'re interested in LEARNING or are up for a challenge and ready to receive A LOT of constructive criticism, this is it. I made a C in 1301, B in 1302;
I took Mrs. Griffin during my first semester of college. I didn\'t know what I was getting myself into. It was challenging, she was very intimidating, but she did help with giving good feedback on my papers. We had to do like a mid-term timed writing and a 7 page paper, as final, and a presentation of you presenting your thesis that you wrote about;
Ms. Lashun Griffin is a really great teacher . If you need help? She\'s there to help you. She does grade her papers tough, but her comments and feedback would help you do better. If you want to pass this course, You cannot procrastinate on her class.;
Professor Griffin is a fantastic English teacher. She is very caring and yes she is a tough grader but she literally GIVES YOU STEP BY STEP instructions on what she is requiring from you. The class is difficult if you procrastinate and do not stay on top of your game . I am taking her for my English 1302;
The absolute worst professor I have ever taken. I have had lots of professors. I am a hard working student who cares about my grades. She is disrespectful,degrading, and worst doesn\'t care at all about the student and just likes to give bad grades just for the fun of it. Also no structure in the classroom;
Dr. Iten loves to complicate everything. She also loves to waste time on clicker questions. In order to get done on time, READ the manual and do ALL calculations before going to lab. Understand exactly what you\'ll be doing in lab to also make it easier. Look at the sample in-lab problems because they are the exact same.;
Professor Iten managed to make me dread bio lab every single week, and she was barely in the room during lab. She wrote the lab manual, which made simple concepts overly-complicated and lab procedures convoluted. They grade the lab on accuracy rather than effort even though the point of the course is to gain familiarity with lab. Overall;
READ THE MANUAL! As long as you show up to lab, you should be able to earn an A or B on the lab, but the quizzes are what will bring your grade down drastically. Make sure the read the manual carefully before class and go to the Biology Resource Center for any help. Know how to do any calculations because those are a good chunk of the quizzes.;
This class was not easy. It is definitely the weed-out course for biology freshman. The main key to doing well was starting off strong. Don\'t wait til week 3 to start reading your manual and the blog or looking at the sample in-lab quiz questions because it will hurt you. You can do well if you\'re willing to work for it though!;
By far one of the best class I have taken so far. Required to write a lot of essays but that is the good part about it. You can really see how much you improve from the first essay to the last essay. Definitely recommend!;
This teacher taught me a lot. I asked for help all the time and she always helped me. The class was hard, though I learned and isn\'t that what teachers are about? Kindness, is one word that discribes Lorrie. I liked her because she was good at what she does \'English writing & grammar\' and found it easy to talk to her.;
Not too bad... Corny but funny.;
Salvo is the best, if you played band in high school, you really need to in college. Band with him is so fun!;
This class is hard, but its a two-in-one gen-ed knockout, and the content is very stimulating. Unlike most classes, you have to actually participate to pass. Sections are easy and offer extra credit every week. Very funny dude. Not much more I can say.;
Extemely awesome teacher...completely unlike your typical professor;
Worst class my first semester of freshman year. She is very disorganized, her lectures are all over the place, so it is hard to take notes, which also makes it hard to study for her exams. Her grading criteria and prompts are unclear, leaving you with little to no idea on how to do assignments/study for tests. Do not recommend.;
Best math professor I\'ve ever had in my life! She\'s truly a gem. Nicest person ever, she actually cares about her students, gives extra credit.;
I love her I wish she taught all maths coming from a non math liker but take advantage of extra credit and you should pass TAKE HER TAKE HER TAKE HER it\'s was 8 weeks and I passed with a B and homework saved my grade giving that you can go back and improver score;
Professor Espana teaching methods were some of the best methods I received at MDC. Provide extra credit and want to pass students;
lectures can seem a bit out of date and somewhat boring, but he cares about his students and he really tries to make it easy for everyone. Class attendance and the oral presentation are gifts from him to you. Easiest 20% of the grade. Just show up! Goes over everything that will be in exams! class paper is easy, just follow the outline. no hmwrk;
She is a tough teacher but she will make sure you learn how to write a paper on a college level and make sure you come to class on time everyday cause she will point and snap you out her class. very funny.;
"Most lectures are half lecture half movie, not very specific on what you need to be paying attention to. Beware, she will not reply back to your emails. Feedback for our research paper rough draft was given back to us 3 days before the final draft was due. She makes you take all the tests twice for a ""chance"" to do better but, its not worth it. :(";
Great lecturer and overall great professor. She knows her materials and explains the process of nursing rather than reading straight from the powerpoint. However like any other nursing classes be ready to read the text. There\'s only so much time to cover all the materials;
Kinda boring.;
No Comments;
Professor Damen is a really kind and energetic professor, however his grading criteria is so hard to understand. He doesn\'t use canvas and your grade is basically unknown to you until a few weeks before the semester. Tests are all fill in the blank but good luck because they\'re hard. Lots of papers with VERY specific formatting and writing style.;
Mark Unno is an amazing profesor. He\'s hilarious and the amount of work you have to do is really reasonable. There\'s 2 short tests and a few papers. The readings are pretty basic, too. I\'m by no means a 4.0 person but this class is very doable.;
Professor Unno gives amazing lectures but at times they can be confusing or he gets off track. He has a clear grading criteria but is picky in how he wants things done. Overall he is a kind professor who genuinely cares about his students and what he is talking about. He is very knowledgeable and I would recommend him.;
He wasn\'t clear about what he wanted. If you want an A, make sure that the shapes you draw are neat and there are no messes outside and inside of the border. No matter how ugly your painting is, he accepts it as long as it\'s neat and it is based on the guidelines. He also lets you to redo any assignment and turn it in.;
Lecture slides(riddled with spelling/grammar errors) and YouTube channels are 80% of the material covered in class. Unless the students are engaged she tends to move quickly/clumsily. Clearly knowledgeable in the subject but not the clearest on answering questions and a little hostile in answering questions even though she encourages them.;
I had Dr. Bakker for both 101 and 102 and it was one of the hardest classes I have ever had to take. He expects a lot and pushes his students to the limit. I hated his class and thought it was very hard but I learned a lot more than other students with other teachers which will and has helped me with other classes.;
I had him for both 101 and 102. If you\'re taking 101 as an elective or as an engineering major, DO NOT TAKE HIM. If you\'re premed or chemistry related major, power through and you will learn a ton, which helps in later courses. Tests are hard but if you put in the work and do a lot of practice problems it\'s doable.;
This guy is awful. He insults people in class and makes a fuss if anyone asks him to work a problem. Has clicker questions every class period and only gives half credit to wrong answers, even though it\'s an attendance grade. Tests were ridiculously difficult, and he never curved, even though test averages were in the 50s. Rudest prof I\'ve ever had.;
No Comments;
Dr. Brown is a great professor. Anatomy is a very challenging course be she makes it enjoyable and understandable . This was my second time around taking Anatomy and with Dr. Brown as a professor I passed with a B! Make sure to keep up with notes provided. The greatest tool to passing this course is REVIEWING and using online lab tutorials.;
She is funny, energetic, and really gets the students engaged in the class. The notes seem hard to keep up with at first but it\'s basically an outline of the lecture shes giving and it goes in order, you just have to follow along. She cares about her students and wants them to succeed so if you go to her with quesitons she is always willing to help;
I took her minority and stratification. She is a very sweet lady. It is hard to understand her because she talk so low. You must read your chapters to pass her test. It is not an easy A if that\'s what you looking for. Overall, I enjoyed her class especially minority groups.;
Great instructor and person. Very organized. Gives great feedback. Practice exams! YEAH!!!! Makes you ask questions. Wish she taught other courses. Absolutely recommend Ms. Phillips. LOVED her and her class!!;
My favorite class so far at TCC. Very fair and understanding. Ask for an extension if you need one. Professor Phillips LOVES biology. You will, too! Study, take notes, do your extra credit.;
"Do not take him! He is more worried about his ""group study"" than the students. The average on the final was 65% and that is considering the curve! I ended up with around 85% on the final, and I ended with a B. The tests are only 15 question each so if you miss 3 your already below 80%. He lectured for a total of a couple hours in the semester.";
He is a great teacher, when he teaches! Which is not very often. He knows the subject very well and is passionate about it . However he hardly lectures. The first day of the semester he sticks you in groups and you better hope you get a good group because you will be each others teachers for the semester.;
He\'s a very nice and lenient Professor. He does tend to go off topic during lectures. Unfortunately we didn\'t get to finish all the chapts and topics during my Fall 14\' semester. Honestly I just think he\'s getting old but he\'s not a BAD Professor. Although he only took attendance SOMEtimes it\'s best to show up to know what will be on tests. No Hw.;
she is crazy- thats what is cool about her!;
He is probably the best teacher at MDC. The class is not easy, you HAVE to study. But he will give you everything you need in order to pass the test. He is really nice and funny. I highly recommend taking him for oceanography. GREAT PROFESSOR GREAT CLASS!;
I had no previous programming knowledge before this class and I walked with a B. His lectures are funny and interesting. He dumbs it down so you can understand the concepts. GO TO THE SL SESSIONS! It\'s free tutoring and anything free is good. They help clarify the lectures and are hands on. Mike wants you to pass so you have support there.;
he could be a little tough but if you pay attention to what is being taught and make the effort to correct your errors it will definitely boost your grade and get a higher grade in class.;
Professor Pratt is great. He\'s one of those teachers who you can just feel enjoy teaching. You never feel intimidated to ask a question and he never gives you attitude for asking questions in person as opposed to in front of the class.;
Do ALL the work. To get an A it is ESSENTIAL you understand the material. It is not simply knowledge based, but application. This class is basically using COMMON SENSE/LOGIC to see if an argument is bad or good. It will be HARD if you don\'t understand the material. if you actually pay attention and understand it, it is EASY. Extra Credit Possible.;
Professor Rooney never missed one class meeting throughout the semester. You must get the book for class. The semester in all was 2 quizzes, midterm and a final and extra credit was available. No homework. Everything for the tests are in his lecture don\'t miss his class if you want an A. I missed 4-5 classes and was able to get a B. Good class!;
The class was 3 hours long but his lectures made it feel so much shorter. He\'s clearly passionate and extremely knowledgeable about the subject. He has high expectations of his students so be ready to make an effort if you want to pass. As for those of us who survived to the end of the semester, we loved him.;
The course itself uses no textbook, so she has her own slides she posts. The midterm/final comes directly from these slides. She is not a easy marker but a fair marker. If you write a B grade answer expect that grade. Read those slides and expect an B+ or higher. Also she adjusts deadlines and grades if need be. Overall very kind professor.;
he was my thesis advisor and i thought he was awesome. he has great explanations and is very helpful, you just have to try!;
Monica in person outside of class she can be nice. In class another story. She is very rude, unreasonable, and she gives you the run around like she can\'t be bothered. If you have to take chem I suggest you take it at Camosun and transfer the credits. I have had to go over her head many times for my lab to be graded again for a proper mark.;
"Professor Sharif is unintelligible. His accent is atrocious, and he speaks as though he has a mouth full of marbles, and his handwriting is somehow worse. He writes both his ""v\'s and r\'s"" as you would a gamma, which come up a lot in dynamics. He isn\'t capable of doing his own problems in class, and made the 2nd test the day after the drop date.";
be ready to teach yourself. doesn\'t prepare you.;
Had Nancy for plant physiology around 1986 and still remember her class. What a great teacher. The reviews that say she plays favorites are absolute garbage. Warm, enthusiastic, friendly, supportive. Clear, understandable lectures. Hard exams. Excellent.;
No Comments;
This class was not as difficult as everyone is saying. YOU MUST READ THE ASSIGNED CHAPTERS or you will not pass. His test are difficult, but the other assignments were basically free points. The forums are opinionated, and the research paper isn\'t too bad. He seems annoyed if you email him.;
I stopped liking Chemistry because of this professor. He would not hear comments and will try by all means to not give points back even if it was his mistake.;
SO EASY! Her quizzes are harder than her tests because the tests are the exact same questions that were on the quizzes that SHE GIVES BACK!;
I am currently in her class. She is not helpful, is impatient with questions, arrogant and basically expects you to know SPSS, Z-scores, T-Test prior to being in her class. She does not go over new concepts, her homework is very hard, no time on class to go over it and balks at questions. Two words. EXTRA CREDIT. She is arrogant and rude.;
Extremely opinionated and grades papers based off the opinions stated. I.e. if you disagree with what she says in lecture your grade will be poor. Worst professor I\'ve ever had.;
HE IS A GREAT PERSON WITH SO KIND HEART. I AM SO THANKFUL THAT I MET A PERSON LIKE CHEF HERSEY AND GOT A LOT OF THINGS TO LEARN.;
I enjoyed the class and teacher. As most History majors, there is addendai reading to be done. Great teacer and am glad I had him in class.;
Definitely the hardest class I\'ve taken at UA. He makes up his own versions of the textbook graphs with about 2 examples, on the hw and study guide. Then he changes the graphs on tests in every possible way, and be ready for him to take off points for your lines not being perfectly tangent and minor labeling errors. Would NOT recommend!;
Dr. Pecorino is one of the worst professors at UA. I am a straight A student, and I think he makes class as hard as he can. I do not recommend his EC 430 if you have another elective you can take.;
Pecorino makes EC 430 the hardest class at UA. Do not take him for this course! Half of the class dropped before Halloween, and the other half mostly has Cs. My advisor said this is possibly hardest class at UA taught by one of the worst teachers here. DO NOT TAKE;
She makes you buy several books that you donvt even use. She signs very english .;
Dr. Kuhlman is the best teacher in the chemistry department. Students will fight to get his class during registration. He is very helpful outside of class and explains his logic very clearly. However he places a lot of class percentage on tests.;
he put question marks all over my midterm paper do not need the book final was so hard attendance counts walk in and leave he lectures for to long;
If you come to class you\'ll be fine. Spent a lot of time covering certain topics and then rushed through others. Very helpful if you go to his office hours, but beware, he may sit and talk to you for hours if nobody else is waiting. Knows a lot about his topic and overall is a very good professor.;
This class was just him trying to prove to the students that he was a good parent. He is very arrogant and self consumed. He provided no help and did not even bother to learn our names. He also cancelled class way to many times, and we probably did not cover half of the material we were supposed to. If you want to learn, do not take him.;
He\'s a decent enough teacher, although you will learn more through the assignments and research than from him and his lectures. Really tough grader on projects and papers and can be unreasonable. My main problem with him is that unless you are interested in venues or meeting/event planning he isn\'t really helpful outside of class.;
I took his online Intro to Statistics class. He didn\'t leave feedback on problems I\'d miss, in order to tell me what I was doing wrong, so I\'d have to commute to college to talk to him in person.;
This was the worst teacher i ever had, people would sleep during her lecture. I recommend to not take this teacher cause a lot of people would fail.;
I\'ll take any class if Prakash teaches it.;
Loved this course. Prakash does a great job giving the material life through his dedication to getting the information across. Assignments were fair, took some work, but they were quite interesting and indicative of what to expect on tests. One thingtrusting my interest in the course, I barely studied for the final and lost a letter grade for it.;
Preston Allen was one of the most weirdest but funniest professors I ever had. He would make a few face expressions that would make a few students laugh. He is straight forward with the work during the semester and how he want things done. You\'ll have around 3-4 essays with feedback provided after each one. Overall, great professor and you\'ll learn;
Professor Allen is an amazing individual! I would definitly take his class again! He made it fun to learn about all the boring things of english!! Be sure to purchase one of the books he wrote they are awesome!!;
This professor is really weird but in a good way. He tells very corny jokes but you can tell he loves what he is teaching. Grades a bit tough but he will allow you to redo something for a better grade. DOES NOT ASSIGN A TEN PAGE RESEARCH PAPER!!!!! I would definitely take him again, great professor and very interesting topics and assignments.;
Ghorashi is a very good professor. Economics is a challenging subject nonetheless. If you commit to understanding the concepts rather than memorizing you can do well in his class. There are only 3 exams so make them count there is very little chance to get grades elsewhere. There is no homework!;
This professor seems like a nice person, but his class is miserable. No clear curriculum, lectures are confusing and make no sense, pain in the butt about attendance and participation. Literally nothing makes sense in his class. He seemed to play favorites. Gives out B\'s and B- . I am trying to avoid any of his other classes.;
She is an amazing teacher. You will learn how to whip up a thoughtful essay in no time after this class. She is very personal and honest. One of my favorite and most memorable teachers I\'ve ever experienced.;
"Dr. Hall is a genuinely nice professor. She will let you make up quizzes and homework with some leniency. Homework and quizzes are assigned bi-monthly without the use of a syllabus calendar. Rachel will say ""at any rate"" about 5 times per class. Very hard to wake up for this class if its at 8am.";
If you\'re looking to take Hall for Sounding Numbers... AVOID THIS CLASS. Yes, it\'s easy but I\'ve learned absolutely nothing. Longest lectures ever and they make no sense. She gives quizzes every Thursday. I personally hated this class because I had no interest in taking a music class. You HAVE to read her notes and she gives a crap ton of homework.;
Entire class consists of him doing examples. He might briefly talk about the concept to introduce it. Homework is on LonCapa which is the worst! If you bring him the question, he\'ll do it for you though. Tests are alright if you review. He\'s a good person, but not the best teacher. Trig is hard, and he doesn\'t really make it easier. No book needed.;
Professor Abert was an all around decent professor for Calc 2. He struggles in teaching you new material right off the bat, and typically expects that you will have read the section being covered in class before hand. He doesn\'t curve or drop lowest test grade, but he is a very easy grader on tests, and gives a lot of partial credit on problems.;
I took his class in the summer and hate history, but I loved this class because he was hilarious and told really funny stories about his life that related to the topic. He lectures a lot, but it\'s interesting because he\'s a quirky man! He\'s also a pretty easy/fair grader.;
I absolutely loved this class. I would definitely recommend him as a professor! He\'s a no-nonsense kind of guy, and his lectures are really eye-opening to what\'s happening in the world.;
"I\'m not really sure why he has a chili pepper because he is old, but nevertheless he\'s an awesome. He\'s really hard but it was worth it. He tells it how it is and doesn\'t give you all the ""politically correct"" bs. He\'s a very cut and dry person. Really enjoyed his class.";
At first I though this course was some sort of joke and this was what sociology was all about. After, taking two classes I realise this is bs. Do not take this class unless you want to hear about his life(no disrespect). You will not learn nothing.;
I took my first class with him the summer before my freshman year. It was in 1972, and my first college course, and I loved him! I took another course later with him, and loved him also then. It has been many years, but his teaching still impacts my life. He was one of the reasons why I eventually changed my major to Sociology.;
Absolutely one of the best professors I have ever had. He makes you feel like what you have to say is important and valid no matter what the case may be. If he had not given me such a good impression I would have no further interest in philosophy. He gives very fair tests, does a great job preparing you for it, and is considerate with his grades.;
She is good Professor! Give a lot of homework, but you will understand everything;
Dr. Sowell is great and she knows what shes doing. But, I feel she could work on her teaching skills. She moves very fast and sometimes dosent show every step of the problem. For someone who is a Bio major and not math inclined this can prove hard. She has really strengthed my math skills though. Take her shes great, youll just have to work hard.;
Don\'t take. No respect for students or their opinions. Super sarcastic and rude. Reading is heavy and the only aspect of the class I enjoyed, that had nothing to do with him. He grades writing assignments in emojis: winky face + glasses is an A while frowny face + smile is a C. Upset I wasted my limited time (and money) on a course like this.;
This man is the absolute worst professor I\'ve ever had the displeasure of interacting with. Arrogant doesn\'t begin to describe him. Weekly blog articles that are short essay length, vague grading rubric. He will not give you an A unless you stroke his oversized ego. Turn things in well before the due date or he will mark you down. DON\'T TAKE IT;
A pretty tough grader, and I\'d say that if he agrees with what you\'re saying, you\'ll do well. Grading is subjective anyways, but he takes it to a new level. Personally, I didn\'t like him too much. The material was pretty interesting on the other hand. My TA this year was incredible though!;
Professor Lecker is an expert on Canadian Literature. He makes a real effort to help his students succeed. It\'s not at all an easy class and it really depends on the TAs that grade your exams. I enjoyed the class and would suggest it to friends. Remember it\'s not an easy A. You need to put in the work in order to do well.;
If this class had been for law students, and a full year it would have been fine. But important sections of business law (commericial paper, life and death of a corporation) were ignored in favor of Consitutional law and current events. If you take him be sure to read the whole book.;
Teacher way heavy on the mid term and final exam. Both are strictly essay which was scary at first. But he is super fair and an easy learn just have to listen to a lot of lecture .;
He is a hard grader, but he wants you to know the subject not just memorize it to pass the test. If you\'re looking for an easy class, this is not for you. You will have to try REALLY hard to make an A. He does not curve, give extra credit, or make things easier for you.;
Prof. Strong really cares about you. Yes, his tests are difficult but coming from a former professor from UT Health, what do you expect? He trains you for nursing school because keep in mind, nursing school is not easy. I recommend taking him if you can accept the challenge because in the long run, you will learn an awful amount.;
professor Strong is a really good professor class isn\'t easy ,and you will have to study ,take good notes ,and maybe even watch a couple of videos in order to really understand the material expected to know on Exams .Mr. Strong does tutor after class or before in groups if needed to prepare for exams .No quizzes, No homework Studying is HW;
Professor Strong is an awesome teacher. He teaches the science and relates it all to real life. If you stick with him he eases up towards the end of the semester. He is knowledgeable and wise. He is always willing to stay after class to help and even held a study group on a Saturday morning before finals. He\'s the best! Take him if you can.;
You can get an easy B, if you read and complete the assignments on time and completely. He\'s a hard grader and the professor will grade based on how well you understood the readings and subjects for that designated assignment.;
Doctor Lorden was one of the most caring teachers I have ever had. She made you work for it but she knew how to get you to really learn the material. And while it was a tough class, I can actually say I walked out knowing a lot of new things. She did allow test retakes. I miss her and if you had the blessing of being her student, you were lucky.;
"Possibly the worse teacher I\'ve ever had. Her lectures were scattered and confusing and often we ended up off topic. This class claims ""no prior programming experience"" however this did not feel like the case considering I felt constantly lost despite reading the book and never missing class. Not good for beginning programmers.";
Professor Fenton is brilliant. Her class was very hard for me though. I felt like she had a very difficult time getting across what she was teaching. She starts a point and then changes it 2 or 3 times before she gets it sorted out in her mind. She\'s sweet and helpful though.;
Professor Fenton saved my bacon more than once. I took her for College Algebra, math and I don\'t mix very well. I made a D my first time through, B in the maymester course. She is a wonderful teacher and always tries to help her students. If you have problems you can\'t be afraid to speak up. She also gives partial credit in maymester course! :);
Dr Tjandra is a very smart professor , he definatley provides you the recourses to well in his class. Practice the hw problems as many times as possible and focus on the material he emphasizes in lecture. Dont fall behind because it will punch you in the face the deeper you get into the course. He drops lowest test and has weekly quizzes.;
Professor Tjandra is amazing! I never thought I would be so intrigued by Chemistry. He really had me enjoy coming to class, which is a first. He definitely wants to make sure you understand everything and uses great examples. Take him!!;
Dr. B is very funny, lectures are entertaining. The material is pretty straight forward, but test (one about every two weeks) can be tough. The homework is primarily calculation based, but tests are mostly conceptual. Don\'t expect any curve or extra credit. Overall, Dr. is a good professor.;
Dr. Peters is great - he\'s a tough grader, and you have several shortish papers, but the lectures are always engaging, and often entertaining. He\'s very clear in grading, so there are no surprises when it comes to that.;
Peters was good but the class was a lot of work. For an LAC class, I spent more time doing tests and homework than for my major classes. There are 6 tests and they are all online (30-40 MC with a strict time limit), but the final is in class (100 multiple choice). There are also 4 article reflections throughout the semester that took a lot of time.;
Professor Peters is a good teacher. He is passionate about politics and has interesting class discussions. His lectures can get long and boring. He does a good job of not letting his personal views get in the way of his teaching. His quizzes can be difficult and he can be a tough grader. You definitely have to work for your grade.;
Mr. Rose brings the world of the unseen to life in his Microbiology class. His attention to detail in lecture and lab is impeccable. By the end of the course I feel that I knew a lot about infectious disease, working with bacterial cultures in lab, and safety. Mr. Rose is a kind and caring professor, while maintaining rigor and professionalism.;
If you pay attention and take notes, anyone can pass it. If you have hard time paying attention and need to be guided every step of the way, then take somebody else.50% of the work is on your own, but he will help out.;
There is a slight communication barrier with her speech which is manageable but, her email etiquette is not very good. She doesn\'t read your questions fully and answers only half of your questions IF she even responds. Her lectures can be confusing because she gets lost. Her syllabus was very unorganized including the calendar.;
Took this class as winter mini. Lectures were all over the place which made it difficult to follow. Overall do not take her an online class.;
Absolutely horrible professor. Terrible temperament and very unclear about assignments. She makes everything as complicated as possible, seemingly in attempts to trip up students. Very unwilling to help students when confused, and simply has no consideration for anyone other than attractive male students in the class. Avoid her at ALL costs!!!!;
Awful professor;
She is not a good professor. Class would be so pointless showing up. Very late at submitting grades. She is SUPER NICE AND FUNNY and class is very CHILL but as a professor she is horrible. Her grading is not clear, she changes things last minute and before you know it, class is cancelled. Don\'t take her if you don\'t have to.;
Simon is a very difficult and demanding teacher. If you take him don\'t plan on getting much sleep or having much time to do anything else besides design work (not even your other school work). He is extremely abstract and does not accept traditional style designs.;
Even if you follow his feedback, it doesn\'t help future grades. Unnecessarily harsh in general communication. That being said, all work was online, didn\'t have to go to campus for anything so that\'s a huge plus. If it weren\'t for the feedback issues and his attitude toward students, I\'d rate higher and consider taking again. Tough but doable.;
Tons of homework and a fair amount of reading each week. Definitely a harsh grader, but he usually tells you what you\'re missing. Not the greatest personality, mind, and certainly intimidating, but it\'s been a year since I\'ve taken his class and the information has actually stuck. Overall - difficult, but worth taking.;
Organizational class was amazing.;
dr wilson is interesting.. he talks to himself a lot and his lectures are boring but if you show up its super easy. you can turn in hw whenever and all tests are take home tests! the final is super easy and you practically do it in groups.;
He is goofy, mistakes are goofy and his class is usually enjoyable. Go to class, take notes, go to review and you can ace his class. Very nice when it comes to grading and his exams are like the review. One of the best at Queens so far;
Great teacher. Very willing to help the students, always available for questions. Definitely the hardest FYS on campus, but she managed to make it a great learning experience. I feel much better about my own writing skills than I did before this course. She can be intimidating, but she is super nice.;
Not as hard if you study her notes AND take notes on any keywords and points she makes during lectures. Just pay attention. I got extra points on all of my papers and projects and most of them were done last minute. However, she\'s so hard on attendance that missing 4 classes last semester dropped my grade a full letter, which was very frustrating.;
I have anxiety issues, and I was afraid of online classes. Ms. Sailors gave me her phone number and let me text/call with issues during regular workday hours. This helped me succeed in my very first online class. There is a lot of reading, but I found the book helpful and informative. I believe i learned a great deal in this class.;
Professor Sparks is a ball of joy. She is an excellent lecturer who is extremely knowledgeable of her mainstream field of expertise (Victorian Novels/ 19th Century Novels). The lectures are quite heavy, yet super interesting. Be ready to read a lot though (6 novels of about 300-400 pages each 1 every 2 weeks). Good feedback. Demanding conferences;
Ted is definitely a great teacher. Truly intelligent and influential in the communication field. Sometimes name drops. I had a really bad TA so it made the experience difficult. However, class was thought provoking and reading-intensive.;
This guy LOVES to hear himself talk! From the time class starts until the very end, HE\'S TALKING! Everything he says comes right from the book! The tests are outrageous and the papers are incredibly hard! He\'s a nice enough guy, but he\'s a horrible instructor!;
He was a very easygoing professor, and very fair. He was always willing to work with the students, especially if they weren\'t doing well. If you show up to class, and you have decent writing ability, you\'ll be fine. If you can\'t write, avoid the class. He was also very clear about what he would ask on his exams. If you do the work, you\'ll get an A.;
He is an ok Professor. Very nice, but can ramble. Going to class is not necessary. He posts all of the slides online before the lecture. There are three exams. The final (third exam) contains word for word questions from the first two, so make sure you review those with the TA. There is a generous curve on everything, and extra credit offered.;
He is very picky about his papers and if you have one thing wrong in MLA style he will take alot of points off! Good luck I finished with a B but it was hard to get the B.;
I have taken classes with him before, but not online and loved it. His on-line course is disorganized and extremely difficult to follow. Took class in the fall and he still had the schedule up for spring. Lack of communication and very difficult to contact.;
If you listen and follow directions and ask for feedback, Thom is really helpful. I am a better writer nok;
Dr. McCauley\'s class was interesting. I learn a lot about society and social issues.;
Prof McCauley got straight to the point during his lectures. Never went off topic. He was a pretty understanding Prof. Although it always seemed like he was in a rush to leave class. The class was usually very quiet so he would always end class early. Pretty easy marker! Always takes attendance but can sometimes be intimidating. Overall, good prof!;
He makes you feel at ease and his grading method is clear and precise. He is also very approachable. I highly recommend him if you have never taken speech and super nervous about it.;
Professor Ballantyne was a great first speech teacher to have. Class was mostly lecture preparing you for speeches, then giving speeches, and there were 4 tests for the semester on lecture and the book. Since class was all lecture it was not fun, but is speech class fun? No. You have to show up, pay attention, and try hard and your best on speechs;
No Comments;
One of the best teachers I have ever had in my life.For anyone who struggles with chemistry, take this teacher! He is extremely clear in his teaching, and goes above and beyond for his students. He lectures in a way where his students can understand, and encourages questions. I\'ve never met a person so kind.;
Very knowledged professor who knows what she\'s talking about and does not try to push her own opinions on topics raised in class onto her students. The class is very interesting and she will open your eyes to a new world.;
She\'s a hottie!;
Chem is hard to begin with, but McGill teaches it well. She doesn\'t have the traditional powerpoint with bulletpoints, so you\'re really going to have to do her worksheets and pay attention. Do all resources given(chem mentors, office hours etc) I had friends in Heaven who had basically the same test as us, but they never really learned the material;
She is a really good lecturer, but she goes so fast;
She\'s really nice and gives good lectures, but she gives really hard tests that will kill your GPA.;
Snider is not an easy grader. If you want an A in his class, you will work for it. On the other hand he is hilarious and never fails to keep your attention. SIAB for life!;
Very unorganized, late to class every day. I learned more from the TA in my lab. Notes are hard to decipher and contain mistakes. Lectures are a waste of time.;
"She grades way to hard, taking points off for a misplaced negative sign even if the answer is right. I asked her for help pulling my grade up and she said ""you\'re smart you\'ll figure it out"". She gets confused and when asked a question just repeats how she explained it before until they give up and say they get it. DO NOT TAKE HER.";
Very good teacher. He\'s soft spoken but takes amazing notes. He is the best drawer ever for a math instructor. His test are exactly like the old ones that he gives out and he gives bonus on every test!;
She doesn\'t seem to know everything she is teaching (only focuses on what she likes but not on the whole subject). Not too bad overall though.;
Personally, I didn\'t enjoy this class. While TAs were very helpful and kind, Professor Ho tended to go on angry rants during lecture. She\'s very passionate, but she would digress from the readings and run out of time educating us on the history. Tests were relatively easy if you did the readings...4 or 5 20 pages readings per week that is.;
Wendy Ho is definitely a professor who cares about her students. She is accessible, approachable, hilarious, passionate and truly a one of a kind professor. She takes the time to get to know her students and is encouraging. Yes, her assigned readings and essays are challenging, but she teaches so much and is a great resource. I loved this class.;
You have a LOT of readings every week. The midterms, final, and papers (2) are based on these readings! She repeats what is important in lecture so you can\'t miss it! Participation in discussion is a must for points. GO TO THE TA for help on the 2 papers! It makes a huge difference. I went from a C+ (1st paper) to B+ (2nd) after meeting w/ the TA.;
Brooks has been my favorite professor at FAU so far. I am a Biology major so this class is important to me but he made the class enjoyable even though the tests were rough. Just need to study well and you\'ll do fine.;
Go to class, random quizzes for attendances. class is grades by points. No phones. Follow his rules and you will be fine. DONT buy the textbook. His notes are online. test are the notes. He uses clickers. He sends emails thing that you need to read (print them out/fill them out/take to class, they might be for extra credit);
One of the best professors I\'ve ever had. His lectures are so entertaining that even when mind-numbingly topics like botany present themselves, he manages to grasp your attention. I recommend him to anyone that wants to have an incredibly clear understanding of biology, while laughing the entire time.;
Great professor but something you should know right off the bat is that tests arent multiple choice. Theyre matching, true and false, and a type of fill in the blank. He knows a lot of interesting facts but the textbook isn\'t really necessary. You need to study but he offers a lot of help. You never use the textbook so don\'t buy it;
Nice guy, but AWFUL prof never hands things back and he is the most unorganized prof you will ever have. Does not have actual notes. Text book is very unclear. You won\'t know what you have in the class until final grades are in. Unless you have a lot of time to devote to this class do not take it! It is not an easy A!;
His syllabus/announcements use 5 different fonts and is just a list of all of the things you aren\'t allowed to do. This class isn\'t about learning to code, it\'s about remembering his rules. Don\'t bother asking him for help. He won\'t answer questions. If you follow his rules on how to ask questions, he will respond, but he will not help you.;
I took two of Mr. Smith\'s classes but I had withdraw during the second class. Now he is no longer teaching at TCC. :( He is an excellent teacher and a very nice person. Thank you, Mr. Smith!!!;
nice, but tough. you have to study EVERYDAY to do well;
Dr. Kim Park teaches EXTREMELY fast. She is willing to go over problems multiple times (with a little sass) till you get it. She is available during office hours and is helpful there too. Exams are straight forward and mostly from the notes/homework, no surprises. She\'s also really relatable. 3 exams, 1 final, homework. 500 pts. Provides formulas.;
Have fun on moodle.;
Avdulov is one of the most caring profs at SMU. He legitimately cared about your grades, your attendance and your happiness in class. But, his class is difficult. Extremely difficult. Required an immense amount of dedication, time and effort. His grading scheme is vague. Thought I failed until I saw my grade. VERY stressful!!;
AWFUL DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS! So hard to understand and never stays on track with anything! Worst teacher I have every had.;
This is a terrible professor who does not care about his students. His homework assignment instructions are vague and if you write a wrong code but has the same output he will show no mercy. He does not explain things well, but expects you to retain the information anyway. I do not know how he is still a professor here at SJSU. Worst experience.;
TERRIBLE. DONT TAKE EVEN IF THERE IS NO OTHER CLASS AVAILABLE. I DONT KNOW ANYONE WHO GOT BETTER THAN A C! SERIOUSLY PEOPLE..NO ONE WANTS WORK THAT HARD IN A CINEMA CLASS! TAKE DR. J;
great teacher, took this class to see I would like to go into business. hes a great guy long lectures and easy homework once a week i missed a few but he gives out alot of extra credit options;
rambles uncontrollably. In general he is a nice guy but completely out of his league teaching accounting. He reads straight off the slides that are all posted on sakai & can barely answer questions. His whole section of the lodmod project is a mess and he cant even help you because he is using another professors outline. This class is a mess;
I had him once a week for trig at night, it was not a good time, but he made the class lively. You really have to work for a good grade but he gives easy and useful extra credit, it isn\'t much but it could bring your test up a letter grade. Loves interacting with his students, will 100% talk to you at least once.;
Don\'t take this class if you care about your grades. I got high A\'s on everything (including second test and the final) except for a B on the first test and a B+ on one paper and I got a B- in the class. You are required to comment multiple times each period. Have to keep a time consuming journal. This class is absolutely not worth the effort.;
Pros: --This class is what he really likes doing so he gets pretty exited about it. --Fun projects if you have time for them. Cons: --Projects can be really hard if you have no experience in computer forensics. --Reads off slides. Overall: --Amidst the dry lectures and hard projects the class was really cool and the professor was helpful too.;
He gives quizzes that are hard to understand . The midterm and the final are a joke. The questions are twisted in such a way to just confuse you. (which I think is his main goal). You will love the class and hate it at the end. Most of my classmates agreed with me on this. Good luck, you will need it!;
"He is a very kind man and is willing to set aside Fridays for ""study groups"" if you are available. His teaching is mediocre, and students correct his problems AT LEAST 3 times a day, so watch out for his work. His tests are medium-challenging and must do homework to understand them. The exam is extremely difficult, so better do good on those tests";
I love this guy, really cool!;
"I have had the honor of knowing Dr. Chen. She has been my professor/advisor throughout college. She is one of the nicest most caring professors i\'ve ever had. She truly cares about each student and for their success. She gives great homework feedback and is always willing to help. We all call her our ""mom"" at school. Great professor!!!!";
This class is pretty challenging. Consists of 1 group project completed in class, 2 tests, and many homework assignments. Chen is a great professor but the topic is hard to grasp. You must put effort and time in this class to do well. Show up to class, read chapters, and ask questions and you should do okay. Confusing class but it is manageable.;
This class is really hard if you let it be. You just have to pay attention in class, do all the homework and class activities, get C\'s on the tests and you will do fine. Dr. Chen is a cool lady and really relaxed. She teaches really boring classes but does her best to help you learn the material.;
Dr. Kelley is unbelievably smart. Its fascinating how much he knows, but he expects his students to know the same. The class is very tough. Need to review all his lectures and the book and do the problem sets. If you\'re willing to work, very doable. Overall, a great person and willing to help if you seek it. He\'s funny too, just pay attention;
Boucher is a really chill, funny guy. He knows his lectures can get boring so he cracks jokes and gets off topic sometimes to make things more interesting. You have to take a lot of notes so it\'s hard to know what you have to study but I\'m horrible at history and NEVER read but I still got a B-.;
Makes you work for your grade but tells you exactly how to get the grade you want. Study the powerpoints back and forth until you know them like the back of your hand and you will be good for the exams.;
Wants all students to do well but makes it damn near impossible. Does not give any extra credit and does not curve any exams which is annoying when all other professors curve their grades. Hard tests but if you read his powerpoints verbatim then you should be fine. Study for the quizzes because those are easy points and do well in lab!;
He is beautiful, but not hot. Get a grip, reviewers. We even had this discussion in class. He is very caring. He is willing to help. You are allowed flashcards on exams, but I did not find that helpful. His exams are very hard. I would be making a much better grade if it was not for the tests. You will spend lots of money on printing.;
Great teacher! Easy exams just study his powerpoints and you will pass with an A the lab quizzes are pretty tough but the biology department makes those you don\'t need a book and he will tell not to buy the $200 recommended book;
Science Fiction and Fantasy Lit is a great class, both because of the subject matter and because of Prof. Jackson. She assigns stories for nearly every class, but they\'re all things you can knock out in an hour or two, at most. Do the reading and you\'ll ace the quizzes, plus she\'s more than willing to review papers and offer useful suggestions.;
By far the hardest class I\'ve ever taken. This class was SO hard. I studied all the time. Cynthia\'s lecture is all over the place and it makes it very hard to take good notes. She\'s very scatterbrained and her lecture is confusing with the powerpoint she makes. She won\'t help you very much in the lab. Wish I could explain some more but I ran out.;
I gave Cynthia some credit for being encouraging but her tests are ridiculously hard and she is not approachable in lab for questions. Her midterms and final exams are beyond what anyone should be expected to know, and when you ask a question in lab she will only tell you that you\'re not correct and walk away instead of being more supportive.;
Amazing professor. Cares about his students. The class is not easy, yet it is doable to get a good grade. Requires lots of time and effort. Professor is helpful in office hours and makes the infomation clear and easy to understand. Be careful of careless mistakes. Class is interesting and challenging.;
Hard as hell, but I learned a lot.;
Great person;
"""One of the worst at JMSB Finance. Avoid at all costs. Random grading criteria (basically gives you a good grade if he knows you). If you insist on taking a class with him, focus more on becoming his friend rather than spending too much time trying to get assignments/projects/exams right."" From another review, but my thoughts exactly. Wow.";
Prof Wong is truly considerate for students\' study progress and is willing help a student with good protaintials to achieve his/her goals. If you are a hard-worker, he is the one to choose to take.;
Worst teacher i had in JMSB, he doesn\'t teach you anything and doesn\'t care about his students, you don\'t know how he grades you, sent him 3 emails to review my exams he never replied, horrible teacher;
She is hard but not that hard don\'t get scared she may give a lot of homework but it is easy to talk to her . She helped me a lot and I would take her again if I have the chance.Remember if u need help with english take her and any way step by her office with any english problem I can guaranty u will come out with no problem.;
Grades with check, check plus, etc. like you\'re in kindergarten. Very tough at grading. Too many readings. The tests/quizzes are timed and you are expected to write 5 full essays during the midterm/final. Talks too quickly. Attendance is mandatory. Quizzes at beginning and end of class. Horrible. Don\'t know how I passed.;
"I have to admit Ellen\'s class is not the easiest but its only because she wants to make sure you get the material. For example, I got a bad grade on our last test BUT I was able to make up the grade by making an appointment with her and ""teaching"" her how to do the ones I got wrong. She is ALWAYS available for extra help.";
If you have Dr. Ream, run for it! He\'s a nice guy, but a very confusing professor. His lectures are random and scrambled. He isn\'t organized. His tests are pretty hard vs the study guide he gives out, and don\'t even get me started on the online homework. It\'s completely awful! I would not recommend.;
While it was evident that Professor Amrine knew his subject, his lectures were dry and didn\'t seem to pertain to the material that was on the final. The final should have been easy, as it was a take-home essay, it really was difficult to know what he expected.;
Frampton was awesome but you basically teach yourself and basically have two tests a final and mid term so don\'t fail them and its an easy A!;
This class was so freaking hard. I\'m sure its easy for mathsciency people.. but this was just really confusing to me. The lecture was so freaking boring. he is a nice man though!!;
Dr. Mann is a class act. He is very approachable, clear cut, helpful, and generous. He gives you every opportunity to succeed in a tough course. Just study his Power Point notes and audio lectures and really know pathways. He is very enjoyable to listen to and has a great sense of humor.;
Great professor. If I was majoring in astro physics I\'d definitely take more of his courses. Good teacher and takes the time to help you, but he is pretty busy. I went to every class and tried. It was a small class and for those of us that tried, I think we all did pretty well. I\'d recommend him to anyone.;
He\'s a great guy. Just impossible to get 80+ in. Class average will be around a low 70 no matter what. You will get no higher than a 75 on the term paper. He\'s an amazing lecturer, that\'s it. Final is extremely difficult too.;
His lectures are great. He puts up detailed lecture notes on Blackboard. He does his best to help the students. Try to read the textbook (read the summary section at least). There are 3 exams and a final;
This is only a 900 point class. 600 out of the 900 points are tests. There are 5 test in the semester. If you do not read the book it is hard to make a good grade.;
Really great and caring teacher. Offers videos of all lectures so that you can study. He wants you to understand the material and is ALWAYS willing to meet for extra help. Prefers to call you on the phone to answer questions over emailing. Tough grader but completely fair.;
DO NOT TAKE HER. I hated her class and dreaded going. Not only was it a waste of time but also a waste of money. I learned nothing. She never went over the class material, she talked basically current events the whole time when this was a class about the 1800\'s. Expected to read 4 chapter books on top of all the other articles she assigned.;
You have to attend class to understand what she makes you read. She lives, breathes and bleeds Russia. Shes a great person and i like her as a person, but as a professor;
All test are straight from HW, but you can\'t view the results until the day before the test. The last homework of every set gives you less than 12 hours to complete. Basically forces all-nighters. Can\'t find HW answers online, in text book, or from lecture content. Expects you to remember everything from stats and know excel.;
The material is extremely dull, but he really makes you remember that it is dull. He tries to confuse you, but you just need to write down every single thing he says. If you attend every class and take notes, you will pass. I studied a lot from the terms of words and it helped a ton even though his last two tests seemed foreign.;
Best math teacher I\'ve ever had. Had to drop calculus twice before taking his class, but got a B with him.;
Corvino was an excellent lecturer. He kept the class engaged and interesting. Definitely read the course pack and participate in class. Discussion portion seemed a bit pointless to me sometimes however the lecture itself was wonderful. Exam questions were confusing and tricky at time but the workload is not much!;
If you need history classes, do not take Douglass. He is not helpful. He is condescending. He doesn\'t answer questions clearly. The only grades for the semester are four book quizzes, a midterm, and a final. He grades very subjectively. Many times you don\'t know why he deducts points. I don\'t know of anybody who earned an A in this course.;
Professor Douglass is the worst professor I have ever had. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS! Attendance is mandatory, (you get three skips, then he says you fail the class), hard to understand, doesn\'t use blackboard or power points, never smiles, need I say more? Find another professor so you actually have hope of passing History and not having to retake it!;
"VERY boring class. Only lectures for the whole class and sometimes pass the class time. Monotoned, uses the word ""uh"" a lot. Avoid if you can! His quizzes and test have hardly anything to do with the notes, Google helped me! Decently rude and not very happy. You\'ll space out once he starts talking, its hard not too.";
He is picky, but his class his fun and interesting.;
You have 3 exams, two worth 400 points and one worth 200 points, and this is the only thing on your grade. The exams are easy to pass as long as you go to the study sessions by the TA\'s! I\'ve only been to this class on exam days, most of the information you need is given to you during the study sessions. Just study and you\'ll do fine.;
He is a great guy, very funny and the class was not boring at all. He does not teach from power points, so expect to be writing down what he says in class. The readings are important to do. Class consisted of 2 canvas postings, one quiz, group presentation, and a cumulative final.;
Wish I could take her for all accounting courses!;
First impressions are everything with this professor. If you talk a lot, you\'ll get a great grade and she\'ll really like you;
She wasn\'t a bad teacher, but not someone I would recommend to anyone else. She makes you read a lot of books which isn\'t great but as long as you aren\'t an English major you\'ll be fine. We were supposed to have five papers and we only did three, and she cancelled class like four times;
She is a very nice teacher but you defiantly cannot slack in her class. Quizzes were given every week so reading was a must and so was attendance.;
The class itself was hard at first, then it got easier. Did not have a good experience with the teacher. She was very rude and not encouraging either. When time came for students to drop the class, she said, if anybody wants to drop let me know so I can get forms ready. She should be encouraging us to continue and help. Not drop it.;
As a professor Kelly was great. Her teaching style is fun and kept me interested. The way the course was conducted was my struggle. The first half of the course is heavy reading that is meant for someone who is an expert in the subject. The books we read are much simpler in the second half. Class was mainly a lecture to confused faces.;
TESTS are HARD! Not enough time to answers questions. Questions are irrelevant to anything, they are random, and there\'s no way anyone would know the correct answer. Don\'t take this class.;
Treats students more like friends than pupils. I needed a teacher and not a friend. At times hard to follow. Take with caution.;
This is a hard class but she explains stuff thoroughly;
I didn\'t buy the book because she wasn\'t here for the first week of classes. Ended up with a B- and I don\'t normally get B\'s. She does not teach, she reads. 4 tests, all multiple choice. Last 2 tests she gave study guides because no one was passing. She\'s pretty out-there and rambles a lot. May have done better if I bought the book but unnecessary.;
Upon meeting Dr. Iten she can seem rather intimidating but you need to go introduce yourself. I struggled at the beginning but then realized that If I just start preparing at least a week in advance, it is so possible to do well. Dr. Iten and the lab manual both put on a scary front but she makes a way bigger deal of it than it really is.;
The best English class I ever had! Her instructions are clear and brief. She is a very easy going professor. The paper are super easy and you even get to revise it for a higher grade.;
Shes wonderful, and considering i hated the subject thats saying something. Learning about research papers is tedious on a good day but shes fun and smart and thought provoking and i never dreaded going to class. It certainly is work but never more than can be handled. You may not like the subject but you walk out with skill.;
Tough grader. Thought the class would be easy and didn\'t work to improve my writing as I\'m not pursuing a degree in the humanities. If you\'re serious about becoming a better reader/writer/essayist, I would highly recommend her. Nice person and seems passionate and knowledgeable. Take your essays seriously. She is not impressed by stoned rambling.;
She\'s a very happy and thoughful teacher. If you take her class she will make learning about communications interesting. She\'ll work with you to help you pass her class. And a great person to talk to inside and out her class. I will still keep in touch with her after her class.;
She is a very unreasonable tough grader. Attendance is mandatory although you are allowed to miss four class days she will not respond to your emails about missed work. She hardly teaches so be prepared to read and seek tutoring . If you have educational questions about a lesson she will embarrass you and ignore you as well.;
Dr. Bakker\'s class was very difficult and not to be taken lightly. During class he tries to be funny, but often goes over as rude and demeaning. He has many times worked a problem out on the board and not explained where he gets the numbers from. He seems like a brilliant man, but not very good at teaching. I wouldn\'t recommend taking him.;
He is very condescending. Drops your lowest test grade. Expects a lot out of his students, and the ones who try come out with an incredible amount of knowledge.;
If you ask a question in class there is a big chance he will condescend to you in front of everyone, and you will never ask another question again. You go through the homework and feel like you will do well just to bomb tests. Part of why the tests are so awful is because he doesn\'t provide any formulas or constants unlike every other professor.;
She is very helpful during her office hours as well as class time, tries to set you up for success;
Professor Phillips is a very good professor. She really cares about her students and wants to seeyou succeed. Her lectures can be confusing sometimes because she goes off on tangents. She responds to emails in a timely manner and is always willing to help out after class if you have questions. Just remember to go to class or you will get lost.;
My advice: Don\'t skip class, do the homework problems, and ask for help if you need it. Horn goes straight to the tutoring lab every day after class and if you ask for help, he gladly will. Don\'t underestimate the exams. Try to study with someone else who is in the class. Teaching each other and learning together will help you more than book work.;
Get ready to read ALOT! We basically read articles that were pointless throughout the semester and got quizzed on them. Blitz is also a confusing guy, he may seem like an intelligent guy, but he often goes TOO FAR with the point he\'s making and totally loses you. Avoid if possible.;
He\'s a hard grader (I got a B-) yet one of the best professors I have ever studied with at Denison. Expect to read a lot, but the workload is still manageable. His lectures were really good and enjoyable (provided you read the textbooks).;
I took several of Mitchell Snays courses in 2011 and 2012, and still remember many of his lectures. Hands down the best teacher I had in my life. Challenging and passionate, he made my love of history endure.;
Most unhelpful college instructor ever! Her exams are very confusing and don\'t reflect her lectures. You can be a great note taker and do your best and read the text boooks but for the exams and papers, unless you write specifically what her opnions are on the subject she will fail you. Many of her questions on the exam are subjective & unclear;
Dr. Spivey really cares about his students. He has talked to me many times in his office about personal life stuff and class stuff. He is very smart in his field of study. His examples he uses in class fit perfectly with the material we cover.;
This is the worst professor at BU. She provides a disrespectful learning environment and is a bad teacher. Do not take this class with this professor, most people do very poor. Take this class with another professor.;
Humorous and amusing in class. Very difficult to work with outside of the classroom and does not offer additional support or assistance. Grading appears subjective as there is no rubric, and little constructive feedback on assignments.;
Very tough class, very amazing professor. His exams are difficult and often contain vague information that he only mentioned briefly in class. If you get any aspect of the problem wrong, don\'t expect partial credit. He\'s super clear in lectures, but you have to work really hard for a good grade.;
"I really like this professor. He\'s one of the best math teachers at Parkland. He teaches ""with"" students and not ""down"" to them and always encourages questions and tries to answer them the best he can. Very pleasant guy to be around and I\'ve found his grading to be very fair. Diff EQ is a tough class, but he wants you to succeed.";
Prof Allen is a nice professor however he expects everyone to be a writer, I didnt like the class at all, and he used to make jokes all the time that were not funny. If you are good at writing take him, if not look for someone else, its no time an easy A;
If you do not pay attention you will not pass the class. He is an extremely tough grader, that being said you only get graded on 5 separate things. 2 midterms, 2 paper and a final. If you pay attention and do the reading you will be fine for the most part, but showing up to class is a must or you will fall too behind and not do well. good luck.;
Totally unhelpful and difficult to reason with. Overall very poor quality professor. Very disappointing considering the high quality of Seneca College\'s other professors.;
He is one of the smartest Proffesors on campus because of the fact he has taught this class for around 3 decades. His grading however is ridiculous and I assure you that you will get no higher than a B. Do not make the mistake I did by taking this class. GPA killer.;
Dr. Lorden is sweet and she honestly just aims at giving you the absolute best learning experience she can. With that said, get ready to work because yes, you learn A LOT. Thankfully, her lectures are pretty helpful and she made the math eay to get. She often calls on you in class. She is a good teacher. Tough course. Can be slow to reply to emails;
She is a tough grader. Tough to the point of being borderline unfair. Each project is 100% correct or 100% wrong. If you had an error, no matter how small, you would get a zero. Luckily, she lets you retry the homework you turned in, for a slightly reduced point total. Which you will do a lot.;
Great instructor. Sadly not enough variety on exercises. Lab and Quiz questions half the time are not near what you were taught. Lectures are great and he is available to answer any questions. But, his grading system is way too strict and he will deduct marks for the most minor error that has no effect on the code itself. Expect 15-20% less mark.;
He is a good teacher. Tests are extremely hard! If you read the chapters thoroughly it will give you a lot better of an understanding. There is not a lot of supplemental materials for what to study. Tests are over 4 chapter and I find it difficult to know the most significant topics out of 4 chapter. Stay involved in discussions!;
He is a bit rude, and gets annoyed when you ask for help. HOWEVER, his class is ridiculously easy. Show up for the reviews, get the test questions, and study that. He will teach you what you need to know, but only tests a narrow spectrum of the material. If you want a great grade, take him!;
Brutal workload based around unclear prompts led by unhelpful instruction. The papers felt entirely unrelated to the course material. I had to fight and scrape for my mediocre grade and I had one of the better grades in the class. When half of your students are bombing, it might not entirely be their fault.;
Lets see. for this online class she has made us read about 5-10 different small readings per week and then.... 60% is knowing small quotes from all the readings over the past 8 weeks. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? She is a critical grader and unorganized. I\'m sure she\'s nice in person but don\'t take online unless it\'s the only class you take. Ridiculous.;
I do not like professor Larkin. She is not helpful at all. If a student ask for help, ignores. she is so rude and strict. she does not care about students. I have never seen these type of professor.;
Ted - He\'s a legend. The man is hilarious and an amazing story teller. Struggled with his essays, but he was always willing to help. Got to that final ready to ace it! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. He\'s great!;
It\'s obvious that Moran is very intelligent in this field, but this is, by far, the worst class that I have taken at NYU. He makes you write three 10 page papers that are worth 75% of your grade and participation is worth 25%. It is basically impossible to get an A. He leaves rude comments that make you feel horrible. Terrible teacher and class.;
He gives a lot of papers and is vague on the material. For the midterm and final he gives you six essay topics to memorize but only two are on the test. Extremely stressful.;
3.5 average and this class is going to bring it down. VERY difficult exams. Do not take class;
Great teacher in CCSF. He\'s very funny, and his logic is very clear. This teacher really get you ready for math 110B and math 110C.;
Good Teacher, somewhat interesting lectures. Steer clear of James Naus for a TA in Madden\'s class he is a horrible grader and will make Madden\'s teaching totally worthless.;
good prof, helpful;
The worst professor I\'ve ever had.... She can be a teacher! She don\'t know how explain anything... My advice choose another professor!!!;
2001 grad. I honestly used a lot of the info from his courses in my masters and for my psychology license. I really appreciated how he didn\'t fill up class time with BS and actually provided practical material.;
"Dr. Langley was/is an amazing professor. I always found his sense of humor... well, humorous, and enjoyed the way he ""weeded out"" the ""not-so-bright"" individuals in our classes. He is the reason I graduated from college.";
Terrible professor, was extremely easy for me to do the work in the class, but that\'s because it all revolves around study guides and learning where countries were on the map. I can assure you that this class is a waste of time, and that this teacher will spend 95% of the class time talking about his grandson or other things other then teaching.;
A good lecturer who tried to make things interesting, but lectures were sometimes boring (it was the material I guess). A tough grader (spelling of terms needs to be exact), but a fair variety of types of questions on exams. Fairly approachable, and fairly caring.;
A little rude but if you show up to class you\'ll be fine ohhhh just don\'t be late.;
The worst math teacher I\'ve ever had. Her tests are insanely hard and your grades are solely based on that. She\'s picky when it comes to grading. Tries to be funny and relatable. Don\'t skip class or you won\'t know anything;
His lectures were very confusing. He pretty much talked and occasionally wrote words on the board. You can get by without doing much of the reading and it was an easy B+.;
Worst professor I have ever had. Lectures jump from topic to topic, it\'s hard to follow his train of thought. Type of professor that somehow is convinced that the shape of the letter G has to do with some deep meaning in the text and the author definitely meant to do that... no. Sitting in class right now with him ridiculously annoyed.;
Aaron Kozbelt knows his subject and he knows how to explain concepts. He is organized. His presentations are clear. Would have liked to have him for other courses. Some professors at brooklyn college should be watching him teach so they can brush up on their lecture skills.;
I passed all the test with As n Bs, gave a very good presentation she loved, answered the questions in class discussions that no one else knew the answer to;
Had Miller for biochem 2. It was more discussion based than lecture. It was bigger concepts than the niddy griddy stuff you learn in Biochem 1. Study and you will do fine. She\'s pretty fair in grading.;
This class is pretty easy if you try. For the tests if you know everything on the study guide she gives you then you will do well. Tests are not scantron but she gives half credit if you try to answer the questions.;
Cares about his students, but the projects are disgusting. 4 projects, as said elsewhere 100% 67% or 0%. Even with resubmissions, the criteria for design points are 100% subjective, not written anywhere, and missing any means a loss of 33% of a project grade. Lectures were okay but finished early almost every day. Tests weren\'t bad.;
Do not expect to coast through his class. Do not expect him to give you answers. Go to him with problems and he will lead you to solutions. He wont give you the solution, he will lead you to it and leave you to figure out how to drink. If you want to learn you will learn a lot from him.;
He is visibly enthusiastic about the content he teaches which always makes class enjoyable. He brings in people multiple times during the semester to teach us first hand about Japanese Culture which was really interesting and broke up the lecturing... The only thing I hated was the mandatory book we had to read. So boring, confusing and tedious!;
Great teacher who clarifies any questions.;
At first, he may seem a bit confusing, but give him time. He is truely one of the most caring and understanding individuals I\'ve ever met. One of OSU\'s best!;
Probably the nicest, kindest professor out there! SImply a genuine guy. Extremely helpful and approachable for advice, decisions or help in the course. His lectures are great to attend, they are all you need to succeed. Highly recommend him as a professor, he really promotes discussions and debate. Great teacher and got me interested in philosophy;
Very very specific about what he wants out of your assignments. Needs you to pander to his own views to do well in the class, leaving not much room for originality and outside perspectives.;
Not the best teacher. He goes over a lot of the assignments in class and makes it VERY difficult to fail. I failed a midterm and the final and still managed to pass with over a 60. Also, DO THE EXTRA CREDIT, It can take pretty close to 10% off the final exam. Very difficult class if you didn\'t take high school physics. GO TO CLASS, it\'s worth it;
Ok prof- he likes to talk about concepts instead of solving lots of problems in class, which helps with understanding but all the tests are only on the questions. You have to attend DGDs for that. But all past tests can be found online with answers and he seems to reuse the same questions every year so its not too hard to do well on his exams.;
"Overall a good professor. With all the bonus marks and ""gift"" marks, he makes it pretty hard to fail his class. He does extra review sessions before midterms and the final exam and it\'s really useful to attend them. He\'s a great lecturer but be prepared to do a great amount of work in his class or you won\'t get a good grade.";
Probably the funniest prof I had last semester. He is a fair guy and gives you lots of opportunities to do well in the course. He tosses free bonus marks. Go to dgd\'s there are quizzes that can result in bonus marks. For 1321 (or 1331) he provides you with all of his course notes which has everything you need for the course. FInd old exams!!!!!!!!!;
The course was pointless, provided no insight into simulation due to her teaching style, and like all of her classes she taught it like a management class and you learn nothing about the subject because she doesn\'t know anything about it. This is the only class that directly involves simulation in the BGS major and it added nothing to my knowledge.;
Work is not difficult, if you do the work then you will be fine.;
Don\'t do it. No! RUN! Find another professor. Took comp 2 online. She never gives a grade higher than a B. Really I asked her. She said it\'s very rare she gives an A unless its advanced college work. Go to the next professor.;
She is a wonderful professor. She\'s fun and slapstick, but is not someone to take advantage of. She knows her stuff, and she wants to help all her students learn and succeed with their writing goals.;
Dr. James is filled with tons of excellent information. He provides resources to help guide you through the readings. Participation and doing assignment using the resources provided you are sure to do well.;
Just keep up with your work and you will be fine;
Lectures are good but quizzes aren\'t based on them. Gives A LOT of work and assigns 70 pgs to read for every 2 days. When I took his class I was taking four others. THANK GOD my other classes didn\'t have a big load of homework like he did. For the Exams he tells you that its covers things that are on the outline, which is basically everything.;
Very boring lectures, professor lectures while most of class doesn\'t pay attention. Low attendance as semester goes on. If you have to take this class it is not hard as it consists of 4 Hw assignments plus 1 ec hw, 2 midterms, 1 finals, and easy group project. Do well on hw as it worth significant part of grade. Also you get page of notes on tests.;
There is definitely a lot to learn from him. Pay attention to all he does, his techniques are great.;
This teacher is amazing. Best math teacher in the whole department. You will never regret taking his math class. I am terrible at math but he is helpful and makes his goal to make his students pass. He is like a friend.;
Bob Baugher is an amazing teacher. He goes through and explains his lecture. I really enjoy taking his class. Its definitely a good class to take if someone close to you has died.;
Dr. Bob is the best teacher I have ever had. He is respectable, friendly, funny, and brilliant. On the first day he gives you all of the essential information needed to pass the class, it can feel overwhelming at first but it\'s incredibly helpful. He fulfills his promise of teaching you all there is to know about Human Relations. Highly recommend!;
Great teacher, very enthusiastic, and genuinely cares about his students. Great guy. One of my favorite teachers I\'ve had.;
I consider myself a speaker with professional training through the military as a briefer and I received a very high B. Other students that I felt were weak received B\'s and A\'s. He seems to grade you off of your individual potential instead of grading you off of the other students. This will benefit a weak speaker and hurt a charismatic person.;
Mr. Young is an excellent teacher to have for Trig! He teaches with enthusiasm and offers a lot to help students, especially during his office hours. Be sure to do your homework/practice tests on time!(Had to learn the hard way) Success depends on YOUR efforts, so don\'t be afraid to ask questions/go in for help. I would highly recommend Mr Young.;
Prof. Siegfried teaches her subject so well and in such depth you actually learn truths about life and not just forgettable test garbage. She will invest in you. Prof. Siegfried has written me 4+ quality letters of recommendation (first job, law school app, and after). Dont be afraid of getting a B+ and learning from the best English Prof. at BYU.;
DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. Every single review on here is completely accurate. If you do not want this class to be your life, DO NOT TAKE. He is rude, condescending, and you do not learn in his class. His lectures do not pertain to the content. He assigns excess reading that is never covered. He also has very basic, if that, communication skills.;
Great professor. He is ALWAYS willing to help no matter what. He is definitely one of the best English professors that TCC has to offer.;
Mr. Potter is very good teacher. You do have to study, but he cares. He knows the material and will give you extra help if you want.;
You would not waste your time on his class. I wanted to become a better writer. I learned a lot from his class.;
Funny thing that everyone is complaining about him this year. I definitely agree based on my experience in first year;
Class is relatively easy, the book helps but its not needed. As for the professor, he\'s a hit or miss. If you\'re late 10 minutes to class you\'ll only receive some credit for attendance. You\'re graded on 5 tests, online homework assignments and attendance. The tests are only 25 questions each but worth 100 points each. He can be very unprofessional.;
Make sure everything is turned in correctly, you will not pass if you accadintally forget something, I heard that she is great if you go and talk to her in person, but she does not understand how to use technology in the least. She will give zeroes if she feels need, and even if she dosen\'t.;
Professor Conrad is a very fair grader and certainly wants his students to understand the material. He had multiple study sessions outside of class. There is a lot of out of class work that he assigns, however, it really helps you understand each and every topic.;
By far the most condescending, mean, disrespectful, and downright rude professor ever. Of all the classes I have taken in my college career, this was the absolute worst. Very unclear instructions not to mention ridiculous amounts of outdated readings required. Do yourself a favor and do not take any classes by her. You will regret it.;
Dr. White is one of the best professors I have ever had. She truly loves students and what she teaches. She is like a mother in the classroom. She is also really funny. She gives pop quizzes a lot and there is assigned reading.;
He comes across pretty strong at first. Scary, even. I thought that he would eat me alive if i ever asked a question. Not true, he is incredibly helpful and respects you for trying and actually asking for help. Great guy, great teacher. He is too funny.;
Pin-cushioning, Proportioning, and LowBalling. If you do any of these things will be ran over by a man with a pipe full of cherry tobacco, wearing a authentic Scottish bagpipers hat, plus he will take your house too. Obviously, live fast or die is a good mindset going in, but you\'ll never find a better teacher to prepare you for the real world.;
Topp truly cares about her students and definitely has a passion for what she teaches. I would recommend her class to everyone!;
Loved Dr. Waterhouse she\'s so understanding and sweet. She really wants us to do our best. She made class interesting and always let us leave early as long as we finished the assignments given;
I love Abbas with all my heart! Having him as a prof is like having a genius grandpa teach you math;
Loved the guy. Interesting despite the topic and always cracks jokes. Easy grader and throws a huge curve at the end of the semester.;
A really great professor, she knows her stuff. You need to pay attention in class and seek help outside of class or you will fail the exams. Midterm and finals were both hands on. Final project used concepts from the entire semester. The textbook is only used for studying so if you can borrow someones do that. Attendance is mandatory.;
chantal is very clear about exactly what she wants and is willing to answer any questions. it\'s easy to get ahold of her and her TA. her lectures are pretty much a summarysynthesis of the readings, so it\'s easy to get away with not doing a deep reading ahead of time. there is no textbook, she makes the readings available for free.;
Doctor Kelly is extremely genuine and smart. If you have a good base in chemistry and read the materials before classes, you could understand all of his lectures and average in the B or A range at the end of the year. His exams similar to previous exams (secretly shared by students) and he always gives feedback in afterhours. strongly recommend;
lectures aren\'t the best, you mainly learn the material by yourself. each exam is cumulative, first exam not a lot of people finish. he curves each exam but if you want to do well in this class you most definitely have to work for it.;
By far the best teacher I have ever had.;
Great professor. Bio isn\'t really my thing but his sense of humor and stories he would tell (related to class topics) made class more interesting. Really cares about students and definitely wants to make sure we all succeed. Couldn\'t have picked a better professor.;
Have to work very hard. Attendance is a must. Lots of high graded HW. (I learn more by studying the material with HW as a guide, not doing hours of fill in the blanks) -A in 1 and B in 2 ( w all extra credit and it being my only class) Passionate, but needs to adjust her teaching style. Wish there was another daytime professor.;
Very flamboyant, fun, and direct personality, which I loved. She is very serious about you taking the time to learn, but learning a language is hard and she is preparing you to talk, write, and even sing in Spanish. Attendance is extremely important and I would also recommend doing the extra credit which will help you towards the end to get an A.;
Dr. Jackson is a very good professor. I had to take her class because it was required. Her quizzes are fairly easy if you read before each class. She is a tough grader when it comes to essays.;
Dr. Jackson is so awesome. One of the smartest people when it comes to literature. She gives a ton of mini reading quizzes, so read and you\'ll do fine. She\'s a fun professor. Take her if you can!;
Overall, Dr. Jackson is a good professor, friendly, and easy to reach. Jackson is very picky and I also believes she grades students based on her history with them. As this was an 8 week course, the work was fairly easy, but increased toward the end. Make sure to have the materials and read. The class discussions were great, you must participate.;
I really enjoyed this class. I took the online version as long as you do the work and really try you can get an A. There is a lot of homework but it is pretty easy you just have to follow the book. One word of advise buy the book from the school. You need a code for this class and if you buy outside the school you still have to pay for it.;
I loved Midkiff as a person, he was hilarious and told awesome stories a lot, but sometimes his lectures were boring or there were things on the exams that we didn\'t ever go over. All of the homework is due at the end of the semester, but keep up with it because it helps on the exams. Most of the homework was way harder than the exams though.;
She is fantastic, speaks clearly and gets all the concepts across in a stimulating environment. I was unfortunate to only have her for the first semester as she went on mat leave as the other prof wasn\'t nearly as good. If you have her you will not regret it :);
AWESOME!!! I love Coach so much!! I you dont like to sing after this class you will love it. He\'s so wonderful!;
Craig really is awesome, he gives a ton of extra credit and really does care about what he teaches. It is seriously impossible to fail the class if you show up and do some extra credit. 100% take this man\'s class if you can, he really is awesome. I am taking one of his classes again next semester.;
HER LECTURES WERE LONG AND BORING! TALKS WAYYYYYYY TOO MUCH! CLASS IS OPTIONAL, BUT BE THERE FOR LABS TO PASS! TEST WERE ONLINE, BUT WE PROBABLY RUINED THAT FOR FUTURE CLASSES. BE PREPARE TO SPEND 100$ ON THE BOOK FOR HOMEWORK! FINALLY BE PREPARE FOR LENGTHY HOMEWORK WHICH INCLUDES READINGS AND MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTIONS.;
Cynthia is a very great instructor, she really does her best to get everyone involved! I enjoyed her class very much, but I\'m not much of a morning person. So my brain was only half awake! Very sweet lady!;
Cynthia really makes sure you know she is there to help you at anytime. She even came to our study group on a Sunday in her personal time. She expects you to work at learning, not just show up. Anyone saying she\'s a bad professor wasn\'t willing to put the work in. Tests are a little tricky, be careful.;
This was a fun class. Mr. Warner is a very animated person and clearly loves to teach. I found myself cracking up quite a bit during his lectures and feeling very open in his class. He is also extremely helpful with speech topics and emphasizes on wanting students to approach him with any questions, comments, or concerns they may have.;
I thought, based on our homework, that the tests were going to be really hard. They weren\'t. At all. Even though I had to drop the class (too many other classes) I\'ve stayed to take notes and learn the material. He\'s even given me copies of tests that he\'s given this semester. Over all, good teacher. 2nd best math teacher I\'ve ever had.;
Reardon is one of the few engish teachers I have had that allowed for insiteful discussions instead of plenty of BS. The literature he has his students read is very eye-opening and worth reading. If at all possible, be sure to signup as one of his students.;
Dr. Talham was a great lecturer, and very kind. Unfortunately, he hasn\'t taught for 10+ years, so none of his practice exams were up-to-date. He assigns lots of optional reading and h/w problems, but you don\'t have to do them if you use Study Edge. Being horrible at chemistry, SE saved my grade w/their awesome review sessions and practice problems.;
Very knowledgeable teacher. His tests are not easy, but they are only of material covered in class and nothing new or tricky. Knows the answer to all questions and is very nice and respectful. Can get an A, but you must work for it and study for the test a day or two in advanced. Fair teacher and very good balance of material learned vs. difficulty;
He is a great prof at John Jay college. I took his SOC343 class 2016Spring. Take home midterm and open book final, A short proposal paper, a research paper 15page long. That was all. He showed us a lot of great documentaries most of class time. And he really cares about his students. Take him;
CIS 111 in general is a pretty boring. You basically learning the fundamentals of programming so don\'t look for this class to be extremely fun. Just study hard. Learn these fundamentals and look forward to taking CIS 111b. Trust me. Make sure you take Professor Kendall Martin for 111b. Her teaching style is inspiring and you work on cool stuff.;
He definitely prepares you for 111b. Make sure you read the book ahead of or after he lectures on this topic. The book definitely explain concepts alot better. Reason why I feel he prepared me was because he tests you on every detail explained in the book which is needed in understanding java so you can program fun stuff in 111b.;
His class was okay. I would recommend lots of studying outside of class because his voice is little monotone so makes you sleepy in class.;
In order to succeed in this class, you must do the homework and read the chapters (at least glance the vocabulary). The exams are exactly like the study guides he gives with a few tricky/thinking questions. He also provides tutoring sessions in case a student has trouble in this class.;
I was really excited to take this course but it didn\'t live up to my hopes. The prof is obviously interested in what he\'s doing but he doesn\'t succeed in making lectures interesting at all. Those who attend usually sleep. And the tests are not related to lecture material.;
Wasn\'t really sure about karate at first never took anything like it but this professor gets you through everything you need to know for every part of the semester. Anything you need to see he\'ll be glad to show you again and gives you all the review in the world for the final.;
Super Nice! Great teacher. Super helpful. If you show up and put in effort she will help you to get a good grade!;
she\'s awesome and explained theory pretty well, considering the whole class didn\'t get it.. i\'ve had her for a bunch of classes and i dig her teaching style.;
This class is just hard, period. Physics is not my forte\'. Mr. Dipert can come off as condescending and confusing but I\'ve found if you approach him outside of class he is a different person. He tells you what to expect on quizzes and exams and leaves plenty of room to ask for help. If you do well on final and project, you\'ll pass.;
Dr. Richardson is easily my favorite professor at Quinnipiac. He has more compassion for his students than anyone I know and it was a pleasure to continually have him as a professor. If you put in the work, you will pass no problem - but if you have a heavy course load, I do not suggest taking him. Wonderful, caring, brilliant! Love him dearly!;
Dr. Richardson is one of the worst lab teachers you can imagine. He is extremely unclear with what he wants for lab reports, texts, and quizzes. I emailed him several times and never got responses. Highly recommend to avoid him at all costs.;
Very passionate professor and very accomplished. He expects the best out of students but beware of his extra times in labs counting fecal pellets. He is very clear when he lectures but please please pleasee record him or write everything he says. Time consuming course but very rewarding. I really look up to him and respect the man.;
Harding is definitely one of the better English profs on campus. He is extremely intelligent and his English accent isn\'t bad to listen to either. He really appreciates when his students go to him for help and participate in class. Went to his office hours once for help on a presentation and he guided me through the whole thing. GO TO CLASS.;
She isn\'t a fair grader. She\'s offends her students. Honestly, there are way better professors to take rather than her. Maybe outside of class sea better, but probably not. She divorced and angry it seems like.;
She is an amazing professor who goes above and beyond to make sure you understand the material . Take her over any other professor! I ended up with a B but only because i didn\'t study nor did i take the small quizzes important. The quizzes really add up!;
She is such a great teacher! She literally helps you out with anything you don\'t get and makes it easier to understand. She gives you all the reviews before exams and finals, they can be hard though if you don\'t study. Very nice and helpful teacher. Would definitely recommend her!;
Lot of writing, but I\'m fine with that. Great textbook choice. Test match the coursework covered. The issue is if you don\'t regurgitate the views she shares (not the text or material) the way that she wants, your grade will suffer.;
Easy Teacher, Easy Grader, Plays Favorites, so (at least pretend to) pay attention in class, and at least once see her in her office.;
Hays is definitely set in her ways but shes fair. Her rules are simple I dont know why its hard for people to follow them. Dont be on your phone, come to class prepared and dont disrupt class. She wants the answers on tests in a specific way but she gives you exactly what you need to study word for word so its not hard;
She\'s mediocre at best. Her classes can be fun and are very easy. however, her tests have nothing to do with lectures and she is very picky when it comes to testing and projects. She can be pretty rude and doesn\'t allow food in the classroom aside of water. She is sweet at times but can be pretty mean that second later. Overall, I got a highly B.;
Don\'t take class if you don\'t like group projects or presenting in front of class. The group project very difficult but you will learn a lot as well. His lectures are hilarious, but the group presentations are often tedious. Very respected teacher and will listen to you. His exams are very fair as well.;
His lectures were very clear and often simplified the material for us. His midterm exam was much easier compared to other sections. All in all he was a good teacher in class and kept the class entertaining with his slides. However on the downside he would sometimes seem annoyed or bothered to answer questions outside of class or at office hours.;
Never had a professor with such vague instructions and unclear grading criteria. Doesn\'t teach anything on financial modeling, you\'re supposed to learn it all by yourself. If your goal is to learn modelling and valuation, you\'re better off going to a seminar like Wall Street prep. I only got As in my 400level FINA classes and this class ruined it.;
One of the best in Concordia! He explains everything clearly and he is always there to help! You will regret if you have never chosen him!;
She grades tough. I had another teach re grade papers and the grades where very different.;
I liked her. Long lectures, but posted the class notes to eLearning. Lots of subject related movie day classes. Two 5-page independent papers, & one 10-page group paper, which I did alone (1 member dropped class, other didn\'t do ANY work, so Dr. Salter told me to do it on my own!). 1st test hard, 2nd is essay written in class (given ? in advance).;
There is a huge group paper and lots of long lectures. There were plenty of (class related) movie days. The real problem I had with the class was the actual grading. It didn\'t seem standard at all, more like it depended on what mood she was in. This is kind of teacher to not round up your grade. You\'ve been warned.;
The reviews about this professor below regarding what type of course work is expected during this class are accurate. However, if you want to work with somebody that wishes to challenge you into becoming a better student I suggest this professor. She\'s tough, but she cares and if you put in the necessary effort and work hard you will see that.;
Incredible teacher, has a great sense of humor, and a true sense to ensure her students are learning material. Curves and other grades are very fair, but you have to work for your grade.;
Hard class with arbitrary requirements. Jams tons of info into her powerpoints and tests on the most random things, and is strict on papers and every mistake brings it down a letter grade. It\'s hard to do well in this class without studying like crazy. Ewa isn\'t helpful and feels that it\'s OK to expect the unreasonable of students. Don\'t take her.;
Dr. Dogru was a good professor in my opinion. She gave very tough tests, but was always fair. The class consists mostly of her handing out packets of the material and were expected to work on it with a group. She walks around and if you got stuck, she could explain it many different ways. She is a very smart woman and rather challenging.;
I really liked Prof. Dogru and enjoyed her class. Her quizzes were not too hard and as long as you payed attention, did your homework, and tried you would do well! When you don\'t understand something, just ask! She is always willing to change her ways and explain in a way that may make more sense to her students.;
Frank is a good man, I highly recommend him to you.;
really hard class, you need to come prepared for each class to succeed. Make sure to pay attention during the lectures otherwise you\'ll be lost. READ the textbook;
Overall this class is pretty easy. His syllabus has most of the words that will be on the quiz and final is optional. He assigns two papers at most throughout the whole semester. Don\'t even try to email him- he won\'t reply. One thing I didn\'t like was that you don\'t know what your grade is until the last few weeks (no e-college);
Gave out a lot of extra credits. I thought she was pretty easy. But then again I love psychology. =);
He is a good guy, a fair grader, and an interesting lecturer. He\'s a really funny guy and he is open for discussion and student participation all of the time, but can sometimes be a little opinionated when teaching the material. I recommend him if you want to take an interesting class.;
Although the tests are tough she is usually pretty generous with grading in the end if you participate and show up to class. She is quite hilarious and tries to make the subject as painless as possible.;
This course is a self-discovery course, so you would imagine for it to involve some degree of creativity. She claims to encourage creativity, but the truth is that she puts countless restrictions to what you can do in your work. During lecture, she says the same thing about ten times over, and she leaves little room for actual artistic work. So ugh;
Glen is a goof ball. He\'s super clear and very understanding of the students. He talks A LOT and often repeats things, but at least you wont forget what\'s going onwhen tests are. If you practice for the SIMnet quizzes you will pass. The lecture quizzes were a little more difficult, but probably cause I didn\'t always pay attention during lectures.;
Glenn is really into computers and tries to instill this love of computers into everyone in the class. Lectures can be a little bor If sometimes but there is a lot of useful information that you can use in everyday life with your computer. If you show up, do Simnet training, and go to lab and put in a little effort it\'s an easy B/B+.;
Glenn is the best person I\'ve ever known, let alone best professor. He inspires me in so many ways, I have lost track. His choice in flowy, big print shirts, impeccable. Take this class if you want to have the time of your life, while learning basic computer skills.;
Its simple, read the powerpoint lecture slides, do the SIMnet lessons, and don\'t forget your iclicker and you will get an A. Its simple. Don\'t make it hard on yourself.;
pay attention to the lectures because you will have a lecture test every two weeks in the lab and make sure to do the trainings online or you won\'t pass. If you study a little you can easily get a b in the class.;
This class is an easy A IF you do well on the lecture exams which can be sort of difficult if you dont study. I showed up to lecture & sat on my phone the whole time but you have to show up for iclicker points. However, you only need to end up with 70% clicker to get 100% so you can miss a good amount. Labs are easy and exams are easy if you study;
i love him, can\'t understand him;
His class made me angry. He wandered off topic a lot. You didn\'t even have to show up to know what was going on. He barely paid attention to the students. He often asked our opinions just to interrupt us, tell us we were wrong, then move on to the next opinion. He was rude and made me not want to go into Mass Communications.;
"Hunter Henson is seriously one of the most intelligent professors I\'ve ever had, and even ever known as a person ... it took some time to figure this out because he is super super humble... he is about 43-45 yrs but has been teaching EMS for 15 yrs? He is a TRULY GOOD PERSON, has strong moral compass, is an RN in ""spare"" time, don\'t expect breaks.";
I showed up for every class, took notes, paid attention and still couldn\'t follow this guy. what a flake;
I thoroughly enjoyed Professor Mann\'s BIOL 2010 class at the Highland Crest campus. I will be taking him for BIOL 2020 this upcoming semester. He tells you exactly what he expects you to know on each test. There are no guessing games. Test questions come right from his power points.;
My favorite Teacher so far! Professor Mann makes this class enjoyable & comfortable. He\'s funny & class is doable as long as you study. He is knowledgeable & helpful;
Big disappointment, avoid this prof and class;
Spears was an amazing prof! He genuinely cares about the students and tries to remember the names of all of the students in order to develop a more personal relationship. He\'ll go out of his way to help you and definitely makes lectures interesting. He\'s always up for a discussion during class which allows students to gain more knowledge.;
Loved Ian! He is humorous and kind. Will get into conversations with you if you\'re interested. His class is interesting to attend, I recommend sitting in the front because it\'s a huge lecture hall. The reading guide is slightly confusing but you can email the TA\'s everyday and they will clarify. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!;
You have to read a lot of books. There are pop quizzes, one research paper, a midterm, and final. He was pretty relaxed with the pop quizzes and let us work with other people. He seems interested in what he is teaching. The lectures could be really boring though.;
Absolutely terrible teacher does not care about your grade or you. He will never give back grades and will not follow what he wrote on the syllabus. His powerpoint slides have nothing to do with the class and he will not prepare you for the tests. If you don\'t have the book your screwed because your basically teaching yourself. DO NOT TAKE;
Prof. Psaromiligkos is perhaps the most clear and precise professor that I have ever taken a class with. He is also extremely dedicated, hardworking and is always willing to clarify any doubts that a student may have. His class notes are very well organized. He is also very friendly and has a nice sense of humor. Indeed, the best prof at McGill.;
No Comments;
I thought that Professor Allard was awesome! He is an excellent speaker which made lectures interesting and engaging. This was my first english class in university and he made sure that the students understood clearly what was expected of them and was very approachable if you had any questions. I am always looking for more of his classes to take!;
Professor allard is tough but fair. He is very clear and concise in his lecture presentation and will give you all the tools and support needed to succeed, while promoting academic independence.;
No Comments;
The WORST professor I have ever had. Arrogant, and disrespectful to students. Have a question? Don\'t bother asking, she will tell you to just rewatch her video lesson. Her quiz questions feel like she\'s just trying to trick you and make you second guess yourself. Organization of assignments in blackboard;
She\'s one of my favorite teachers I\'ve taken. I actually took her last semester but I liked her enough that I thought everyone should still know SHE\'S AWESOME. She is clear on the work and you go over it in class. I would\'ve taken her for 2010 as well if she offered it..;
awesome teacher and is fun. knows his stuff. lots of work though.;
Dr. Kent is flicking awesome... most definitely NOT EASY but A&P isn\'t easy and I am grateful to have had a professor that was so committed and knowledgeable since I have drawn greatly from what I learned in his class.;
Dr. Spock was very helpful in all the assignments and gave great feedback;
She was difficult for a 100 level course. Four tests all semester including the final. Not difficult at all as long as you do the work and take the notes. I loved her! Great personality.;
Her teaching is elementary. She literally sat us down during one class and showed us a video of a man showing the process of how a first grader learned to draw a butterfly to a bunch of other first graders. Very rude, doesn\'t take the time to have conversations with students, and if you question any part of her teaching, she snaps at you.;
Inspirational teacher! He is there for you, if you need help don\'t be afraid just ask! expects you to try in class and on your assignments. Do not take his class for granted you will learn to pick out your own mistakes overtime :);
Good professor and a cool guy. Super helpful to go to office hours. His exams really test your understanding;
JJ made you work hard but she was so knowledgeable, I learned a lot. She cared about whether her students were doing well. Even though she seemed strict and tough to talk with, she was pretty easy to talk to once you initiated it. And she would bring scones for AM classes and snacks and tea for PM classes!;
No Comments;
Hands down best math teacher I\'ve ever had. If you ever have any questions, GO TO OFFICE HOURS. I went almost every week with homework questions and he was so so so helpful. His tests and homework are fair. He drops your lowest quiz as well. He is a very clear and organized lecturer, and is extremely approachable and helpful. Sweet sweet guy.;
Professor Burk is awesome! Best math teacher I have ever had. He truly cares about his students and goes to great lengths to make sure that everyone understands the material.;
He is the best professor I have ever had! He has so much energy so it doesn\'t matter if you take him in the morning or at night he will keep you awake. Take notes in class, participate and attend class you should be fine.;
EASY CLASS. Attendance isn\'t mandatory. You buy the book, read it and do the online assignments. If you want to actually learn, take another class, if you want an easy A. Take this class. He also doesn\'t keep you for the full hours of the class.;
Best math teacher I have ever had. He taught math is a way I could understand and always available for help. Had office hours before class, I would stop in every morning to ask questions either on homework or take home quizzes. Helps you on quizzes or offers you to redo tests for credit. Builds relationships with students, funny and is awesome.;
His lectures are long, the way he talks makes you want to sleep and the tests are not a good time. Three blue book essays, that\'s it. Not very understanding, old geezer type who doesn\'t care about your grades. Class not overly challenging but would not recommend taking it from him.;
If you enjoy history Professor Reed is probably the best you can get. I found his lectures on point and enjoyable and he clearly has a vast knowledge of American history. He provides many real world and personal examples that are useful and make the class more enjoyable. He finds modern day things to compare history to to help you understand.;
Do yourself a huge favor & don\'t choose Richards. She is extremely unorganized in her lectures & rambles about nonsense for the first 25 min of the class, and then expects you to have actually learned something. Class is out of 100 pts, w pop quizzes worth 8, & the final paper (which you put hours and hours into) worth 15... makes no sense. Unfair;
Dr. Fisher is really funny. He\'s undoubtedly very knowledgable, but he lectures EXTREMELY fast. I recommend rewatching Tegrity for his lectures, because he often elaborates on his slideshows & says things that\'re not written down but that he will test you on. On the tests, he usually never takes questions directly from his HW, he rewords them;
This was the worst professor I\'ve ever had at GW. Seriously avoid him. He\'s mean, overly critical to students, and just plain down rude if he doesn\'t like you. He seriously scared me. He was just that bad of a professor. Take another class because most likely you won\'t get an A or even a B in his class.;
Super easy. show up to class. take some notes. stay for the films. only 2 tests (midterm and final) both are open note and open book. and one extremely easy paper. no reason for anyone to get lower than a B. He\'s a no BS kind of guy. He knows what he is talking about.;
She\'s a great teacher. She\'s funny. She talks to us, and the whole class is a conversation. It\'s a class that you wouldn\'t mind going to. Group discussions are great. Group discussions are most of the class. Because we all give our individual opinions, it\'s easy to learn and be engaged.;
The reviews are most definitely correct about her . She is very defensive, and wont let you get a point across . She is very funny but rude at time . The class is a easy grade tho . The book is not really needed buy an online book for cheap .;
As im sure she loves what she does, her teaching method was not for me. If you are a self learner then you will be bored in this class. Read the book and follow the online assignments and you will pass. This is part of my major and i didnt learn anything from the teacher. Also, READ THE SYLLABUS, explains her grading style.;
Karen Douglas was a good lecturer but we have weekly chapters to read and weekly (sometimes twice a week) quizzes. The quiz questions came from a question bank, and she didn\'t check the questions over before putting them on the quiz! A lot of times the questions wouldn\'t make sense. But, the one group presentation was easy, if you got a good team.;
I do not remember the course code, but the course was a 300 level and was intro to american legal systems. She was very cool and down to earth. She is not one of the professors who think that because they have a degree, they are better than you. Although the note taking can be confusing at times, she is magnetic and I would recommend to anyone.;
Enjoyed the guest speakers and class activities. Applies to real world. A bit of work but fair.;
She\'s okay. Material is really boring and she doesn\'t help making it any better. SHE LOVES TO TALK. Hour and fifteen minute class and she talks the whole time. She\'ll tell you a million times her husband is a pilot and loves to boast herself and talk about all her research but the class is pretty easy if you just study the power points.;
Amazing teacher she made me love to class and not a lot of teachers do that. She makes education fun when it\'s really not and she teaches you the best way and all of the criteria unlike other lazy professors. I recommend Kathy but at the same time a lot of people are getting to know she\'s the best so my advice is pray you\'d get in her class;
This is a difficult subject, but Ruhi does a good job of explaining the material. Exams are tough, but they are manageable. Discussions are graded. He does have an accent, but is definitely understandable. I would recommend this professor.;
Great Professor. Little bit hard and there are many things to read but very intelligent and try really really hard to help students. If you actively ask for help you will get an A. Not easy class but if you try, you can get an A. A range is quite wide as well. She gives lots and lots of extra credits.;
She really knows her stuff, but her lecture slides aren\'t very helpful. Offers extra credit quizzes a couple times throughout the semester so I\'d go to lectures;
His class was really great. His lectures were really interesting and he used recent events so you can relate. If you do all the homework and do alright on the test then you\'ll pass. The homework is extremely easy. Attendance isn\'t mandatory, but you do group work in class somewhat often.;
Very nice guy, good sense of humor, very helpful;
Dr. Rahimzadeh is by far my favorite professor. He is so helpful and tries to connect with each student. I have been to his office multiple times and he always encourages me and tells me what to do to get better with my work. He also keeps his lectures interesting and makes the entire class laugh constantly. I would recommend taking him.;
Dr. Gubacs uses her class to present her work to up and coming teachers. The class has no purpose. She is very unorganized and the class was a hybrid and assignments are unclear. She cares more about her outside stuff then her class. I was extremely disappointed with the course. She also loves to talk about how great she is.;
Sadkowski was a nice guy but his lectures were really boring and there was a lot of reading involved. Tests were difficult but he has a pretty nice grading scale, so it evens out a bit.;
"Dr. Asplin is really knowledgeable and is good at explaining tough material. She is a great resource of information for psych students especially. She can come across as very serious at times, but she\'s also very laid-back and forthcoming about her expectations. Attend class regularly because she really helps you to ""get"" the material. Do the h.w.!";
No Comments;
Dr. Griffin is a great person, very funny and cares. She barely teaches during lectures, and your weekly work was online and would be due at weird times throughout the week. She also had online quizzes and a couple extra credit papers. At the end of the semester we had an APA research paper and a 3-5 min. vlog which was difficult. very tough grader;
She\'s a good professor overall, but if you\'re looking to do nothing and get an A she\'s not for you. She\'s a tough grader, but is there to help if you ask. She\'s adamant about class participation so she\'ll call everyone out at some point. Her class isn\'t easy and only those who really want to learn will stay. My class count went from 30 to about 8.;
I was so hot and cold with this class. There were some days where she actually taught the material and other days where she just rambled on about nothing and made me wish I\'d have stayed home in bed. She can be pretty funny and sometimes her lectures were interesting.;
"I am a Genetics major and science is the love of my life. This awful teacher left me wondering whether I should even be in the field of science after every class. She is horrible, sarcastic, soul-eating, and her ""revered"" lab manual is the stuff nightmares are made of. My only recommendation is that if you don\'t have to, DO NOT take this class.";
Class becomes impossible second half...To much for a Gen Ed. Should be called meteo 450...DONT TAKE METEO 101;
I loved taking this class from Linda. She is great! She was very understanding about everything. I turned in a few assignments late and she didn\'t mark me down for it. All she really cares is that it is completed and that we did out best. There are a lot of papers but she is willing to help you and accommodate.;
"i sutdy online make sure your keep with your online work, the test are a reflection of your homework there were no surprises. its def possible to get an easy ""a"" in the class just do your work";
I really don\'t know where to begin about professor espana. WOW WOW WOW is all I can think of. This professors offers so much extra credit opportunities!!! Put your best effort in and you will pass. Trust me, this is coming from a student that almost didn\'t graduate high school because of math. Easy breezy beautiful miss espana.;
In a history of math classes I\'ve taken Ive never actually received A\'s of any of my test. She even gave us candy ,DO the extra credit trust me it helps!;
professor espana is a great person. she loves helping her students. if you pay attention in class and do the online homework you will definitely pass the class.;
"She teaches really good, her exams were based off everything she teaches. I did not understand math and she made it so simple. My only issue is class attendance. I missed class once and was not able to make up her work even though I had an injury. Five points from an ""A"". SKIP CLASS YOU WON\'T PASS. Also beware of group work.";
Shes a great teacher, she takes some getting used too but she makes you work for the grade, she gives PLENTY of extra credit so take use of it. At first she seemed harsh but I came to see she is actually a really good professor.;
Professor is both knowledgeable and caring. She wants her students to succeed and is willing to work with you. BUY/RENT THE BOOK, you\'ll need it for the test and quizzes. Also, if you can take her for both lecture and lab (hurry her classes fill up fast).;
He\'s honestly the best teacher out there. I am so glad I took him. His grading is pretty easy as well. He does try to help his students out by giving a practice test before the actual test. Hes a very understanding and wonderful teacher.;
Professor Potter is THE best sociology instructor. He genuinely cares if you\'re understanding the material and is more than willing to help. Lectures were quick and informative. His one-line jokes are an added bonus. Definitely take Professor Potter if you have the chance!;
Nice guy but a tough teacher. All classes are straight lecture so be ready to take notes. For tests he gives you 40 terms and 5 essays, he picks a portion of them on test day. I had to work hard for a 3.3 and I have a solid background in APUSH. take it only if you\'re very serious. Even then, take with caution.;
MAM is the bomb! She\'s a tough grader, but an extremely brilliant woman. You can learn so much if you listen and are involved in class. Do your work, show up to class, buy the book, study for exams/quizzes, and enjoy the classes she teaches!;
Best professor ever;
Amazing lecturer and fair grader! Absolutely love her!;
Dr Fressola was tough but a great clinical instructor. She didn\'t make it easy but she respected that we were students and would tell us if we were making mistakes. She was very good about being professional when telling you about mistakes. She always had you step off the floor for comments. I learned a lot from her and I am very thankful.;
No tests are given, all you have to do is write the papers. She truly cares about her students and learns each students name. Works with you on anything you need help with. Makes class go by fast.;
She was an amazing professor. Lectures go by very fast, and almost all of the time you are out of class 30-45 minutes early. She got to know all of her students. Would definitely recommend her!;
Dr. Rose is a nice person who loves what she does, but she is not good at teaching a large class. She goes through slides too quickly, not caring if people are still writing. The stories she chooses are strange and the assignments are unclear. I wouldn\'t take another class taught by her.;
I was very intimidated at first but it wasn\'t as bad as I thought. I am not very good at anything English/Lit related so it was tough for me but I ended with a B+. You just have to participate in the discussions as much and as well as you can. It was online but she seems very easy going and friendly.;
Interesting, engaging lectures. He\'s a cool guy that always has interesting stories to help you understand. A lot of papers and a couple tests, and a ton of reading, but the whole class is fairly laid-back and interesting so it doesn\'t feel like a big workload.;
This is the best class I have taken at U of O so far. It gives incredible insight into the dark side of self in religion just like the title suggests. Beyond that, it really teaches you a lot about yourself, I started my journey of self-discovery, which is something I did not think I would be saying. It is an amazing class, I highly recommend it.;
I do not recommend her at all. I would avoid her as much as possible. treats you like a high school student. poor time management skills. she got many problem wrong in from of the class in a row. Does not know material copies straight from book.;
A good lecturer, if not a bit arrogant. He\'s the kind of professor you hate to have while you have him, but will be grateful for after you leave him. However, I\'d only recommend his class if you\'re going to being using chemistry in future courses. It was a lot of effort, and very stressful.;
Gives lectures mostly on concepts and theory with very few example problems and expects you to learn how to do most problems on your own. He does clicker questions for a grade every class. I would not recommend him to anyone who does not have a strong chemistry background. He also gives no equation sheets for exams.;
Make sure you do as many practice problems as you can to prepare for the test. The test will be much harder then other classes so study and put in the hours. There is no clear grading criteria even though he says there is in the syllabus. I still have no idea what my final numeric grade was. Take a different professor if at all possible;
Take another teacher. He\'ll do problems in class & make sarcastic comments about how much faster he can do them. Tests much harder with trick questions than other sections & u don\'t get to use formula sheet on final. You might learn more in his class but you are unlikely to get in A unless you\'ve had AP chem and grading criteria not clear.;
Hes not that great of a teacher. He talks about a lot of irrelevant things. You learn more about him than you do about the actual subject. He does curve, but you don\'t learn. WHICH SUCKS! Hes nice, but his class and ethic are annoying. He doesn\'t teach well. His test and lecture doesn\'t correlate! JUST study and stick thru the class;
Avoid at all cost. She lectures the entire class time and the majority of what she says isn\'t even what will be on the test. She talks more about her personal life and personal opinions than the material that we actually need to know. Her test are tough and without the book you will have no idea what is going on. This class is miserable.;
Great teacher. If you are a hard worker you will pass.;
Mary Wells Phillips, BIO for Majors. She is a great professor. She can be a bit confusing but SHE CARES. Shes super sweet, and cares for her students education. You WILL have to do a semester project that deals with research or volunteering work and a presentation for all of it. You can either choose a research project or to volunteer.;
Dr. Horn has a very unique teaching style. In short he doesn\'t really teach. Everything you need to know will come from the textbook, the in-class activities will just confuse you and waste your time. His tests are super vague and hardly reflect what was learned. This class does not prepare you for later chemistry courses. Find another teacher.;
I took him my first semester and all i remember is that he has an asian wife who he spoke of most of the time and joked that its good that he has tenure. I gave him a 5 for difficulty bc I was totally unprepared for the tests because he didn\'t teach. He even yelled at me once because i asked to many questions, actually yelled bc i showed interest;
I took this class at the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee with her. It\'s a class about vampires and it is really interesting, but don\'t take it if you just want an easy course that doesn\'t involve much. If you like to read and write, than it will be super easy. Be sure to show up to class, though.;
I had professor B for 5 classes and now a 6th. Obviously I think he is a great teacher. If you do the reading and writings on time, and participate you can do well. A lotta reviews say he is scary which I totally get but it\'s mainly because he wants you to work hard. He also does not tolerate foolishness.;
My 3 tips for anyone taking a class with Blitz: 1) do NOT come to class unprepared. 2) participate. 3) enjoy yourself. He is awesome. A little scary sometimes but he really wants his students to do well.;
He\'s Hilarious. I had to go to is office hours which really helped.;
This was a very boring class - he would go off on long discussions about topics we couldn\'t care less about. Tests required memorizing answers to study guide questions - you certainly won\'t actually learn any of this stuff. Overall nice guy, though, and definitely loves what he teaches.;
I took his 16 week online course, and for anyone who is considering taking it be ready to read, answer questions in clear detail, and sit down and really work on the course for at least 2-3 hours at a time. If you really put in the effort, you\'ll easily pass. Plus, he\'s a great professor and pretty funny, too!;
Never physically met her, but she responed to emails promptly. I enjoyed the class, we used the test and the tests came right from that. Make sure to study for exams, lots of memorization and cover a lot of material.;
Don\'t take him if you plan on taking Dynamics. He is supposed to be pretty good with Fluid Mechanics, but he wasn\'t very comfortable teaching Dynamics.;
He was a great professor very specific in what is and is not going to be on the exam.;
Professor is very nice and care students but the contents are absurd (Complicated Universe is trying to be shown within one semester) and test questions are enormous within limited time All in all, you will not even expect where does the questions come from d(^_^o);
I took her abnormal psych class first then intro to bio psych. She is a very nice person and genuinely cares abut her students. Honestly taking her classes taught me how to study better. Basically study everything especially test notes i only used textbook for clarification & if she couldn\'t cover something in class. Work hard don\'t procrastinate!;
Dr. Arrey wrote the book on Organic Chemistry. Literally. He uses a textbook that he wrote himself. The funny thing is, it\'s more helpful than traditional textbooks. Dr. Arrey has such a unique, and often hilarious, way of explaining difficult concepts that achieving highly is inevitable. Study hard, go to office hours, and don\'t be a Chlorine Guy.;
She isn\'t a bad professor but definitely give A LOT of work;
Professor Powers is the best teacher I have ever had. He LOVES to teach more than anything and you can tell this because of his enthusiasm and love for chemistry! He is an awesome person and does anything to help his students! His organic class is hard but it is the best class I have ever taken! you will love his teaching!;
7 papers for a short summer term!!! please do yourself a favor and DON\'T take her class. Tough grader. endless homework.;
Do yourself a favor and do not take this class. The papers that you will be directed to write will come with vague instructions. When you follow the instructions, guess what, the rules change and you are penalized. Unfair grading, vague descriptions, topic jumping (also vague), you do not know how she arrives at your grade, because its made up.;
Her course is fairly intense, so if you aren\'t willing to do a research paper or read your textbook you\'re going to have a bad time. The lecture tests were easy if you pay attention (I did), and the reading tests were easy if you read (I didn\'t). If you write a good paper, take good notes, and read the book you should be fine.;
The most time consuming class I\'ve ever taken. She is a tough grader but very detailed in her feedback. Online class had 7 total papers and endless online discussions. I asked her a question about one of the papers and she was VERY rude about it. I\'ll admit I didn\'t read the entire assignment but still, she could\'ve been nicer about it.;
This class is definitely a challenge but one that I enjoyed. She does assign alot of work but gives plenty of time to turn them in. Some say that she\'s opinionated but I\'d like to think of her as a free thinker that\'s aware of the problem with society. She wants students to think, and i can appreciate that. Study Study. I pulled off an 87;
Bush is the type of guy who only wants to hear what he wants to hear. He doesn\'t like when people correct him and he assigns many assignments (multiple due on the same day & sometimes forgets they were even due). Also, his favorite thing is calling on every single person in the class and putting them on the spot with questions.;
5 week summer course. Only take this class if you absolutely need to. There is a ton of homework that averages about 2-3 hours a night. Mcgraw Hill based Connect. Do all the practice, the tests are hard but not if you study all the content. The last two exams are challenging. She provides PowerPoints with her speaking. Professor did all she could.;
Terrible communicator. She does not respond to emails and when she does,she is short almost annoyed you even asked. She does not do any grading AT ALL. The computer does all the grading and she does not check over to see even if that is correct. We were given extra credit assignments and she did not even include them in the final grade. Terrible!!!;
Hybrid class, meets only 6 times in physical class. You will have an assignment due every weekend on blackboard. Somewhat of a tough grader, expects a lot from you. not a bad professor though. relates a lot of real world things/music.;
"The good: the weekly readings. Topics varied among articles, chapters out of books (good stories), and interpreting rap cyphers. Keeping the topics engaging is important because like I said, they\'re weekly. 3 papers, sometimes he\'d say he told us something that I didn\'t recall him saying. ""I told you guys a million times do this and that"" When? Lol";
Geib knows what he\'s talking about and is very passionate. Grades consist of 2 group presentations/papers, 4 short essays, and 2 tests on important terms.;
Dr. K is the best chem prof ever... he gives a ton of extra credit opportunities, very laid back, pretty cool over all. his class is much easier than any of the other classes, at least for Gen Chem. try to get his class.;
PHIL NYE THE CONCEPTS GUY (PHIL PHIL PHIL PHIL...);
I understand why people love him, but I have some reservations. He\'d sometimes aggressively pick on the kid in our class who\'d ask too many questions (fair enough, but I think the kid had some social issues), and although I appreciated he was honest he might have done more to discourage than encourage Brilliant Professor though, teaches very well;
Great professor, his class is really easy to pass. His work and essay topics are essay. Make sure to turn in work on time and you\'ll pass. My favorite thing about Allen is how he grades, he is not a tough grader at all. I don\'t write so good and all my essays have been higher than a B. His classes aren\'t boring so time goes by fast!;
Ghorashi is a nice enough guy but the class was awful. Being in the class was agony, nothing but student presentations and meandering, pointless lectures by the professor. He didn\'t really explain any of the homework or projects, finishing his assignments felt like guess work. Honestly, I don\'t even know if he knew what he expected us to do.;
One of the best classes I have taken at IU and that is because Professor Parameswaran was so fantastic. The nature of the course is interesting so that really helps when there is a lot of reading assigned. Prof. P. makes you work for your grade, but she is very genuine and is one of the best personalities of the IU Journalism faculty.;
She is one of those professors that expects you to fully understand a concept after one explanation of it. The way she explains things is very vague and confusing. She needs to find a different approach because the way she does thing\'s now just isn\'t cutting it. Please do yourself a favor and try and find a different professor.;
She is tough, wants you to participate to help you understand Finance. She really cares about you learning and getting something out of class. Last semester she started using online resources which made some of the homework easier.;
She is amazing professor! Her explanation is so clear and so easy for understanding so you can forget about math problems that you had before :) Moreover she has warm heart and she is very kind professor;
She went through whole lectures too fast because her concentrating group was who already studied in high school or worked in Accounting field. I prepared for the first class with reading the first chapter, but it was totally useless.. There were quite a lot of students(8-9) who already know everything and the professor taught them, not us.;
I took his class a few years ago and I really liked him! He seems like a genuinely nice person and he has a really funny sense of humor. I recommend his class!;
It is very frostrating when you\'re trying your best, put a lot of affort, which normally will help you to succeed, but as a result you get a low grade and the interest to give another speech is gone. If you have a chance to take another class, do so.;
A class on the body could be mind numbing or awesome. The downside was that a lot of things weren\'t discussed at all;
Good at explaining new material. Moves at the perfect pace. Will answer any of your questions perfectly. Tests are a lot easier than the home works. Gives partial credit on tests. Tests are only 45% of the grade so if you fail one dont worry.;
Excellent prof. I took it as a summer course and we had to jam through the whole course, but he kept things lively and even though he had so much material to cover in almost no time. I\'d take his class again. He doesn\'t mind if you get the previous edition of the book either. Saved me $$$;
He\'s an awesome teacher. Best math teacher I\'ve ever had.;
An easy teacher a few homeworks but no test. You will leave this class actually learning something.;
Hes so adorable!! TAKE HIM! he lectures a lot but theyre very interesting. hes an excellent anthropologist, and he always has amazing stories to share. he gives a lot of assignments but you have the whole semester to do them, his assignments are very simple. Easy A !;
One of the best professors I have ever taken. No exams, no textbooks. Great professor and easy class.;
great guy, great teacher, highly recommend him;
Not a good teacher. Passive aggressive. Very rude. Snarky. Don\'t take his class. He\'s honestly the worst person I\'ve ever met.;
Hard grader but overall funny, interesting, and knowledgeable teacher.;
Cute little old guy, very nice, funny, not hard, just have to show up and engage in class;
Professor Stecker was very knowledagble about philosophy, however if you don\'t need to take the class don\'t take it. He gives you handouts with everything you need to know, but classes were very dry and boring. He had no clear scheduale and papers had no comments.;
I actually would take her again because personally, I\'ve enjoyed writing her papers. I\'ve taken her for ENGL 848 and currently, ENGL 100. Your grade is based on five essays and you can\'t skip one at all. The topics were easy so writing the papers were a cakewalk. Instructions for essays were straightforward. Basically, just do all of your work.;
His lectures can be boring at time, all he does is lecture the entire time and the tests are essays based on mostly the text, some on lecture. However he is SUPER approachable and willing to help as long as you ask. He has been the most helpful professor I\'ve had so far, he wants all his students to succeed you just need to reach out to him.;
one of the nicest profs i have ever had. very approachable outside of class and will work with you to help get the grades you want. you definitely have to read so being lazy wont cut it. all grades are essays which isnt too bad because he gives the questions a week ahead of time and goes through them in class. lectures can be random but worth it.;
He will kick your butt and you will thank him for it. Our class went from 30 students to less than 10 by midterms. Read his powerpoints as he leaves clues as to what he will test on. Listen to his advice and study at least 24 hours a week. Make your own study guides. You have to put in the effort but he will work with you to help you succeed.;
Prof. Strong is extremely energetic, makes sure everyone is participating throughout labs and lectures. If you put in the effort he will do the same. Skipping a class isn\'t the best idea, he does move quick but the book and powerpoint do help! He makes all of his tests and makes every question critical thinking (really tough).;
Strong was one of my most favorite teachers. About half of my class dropped, but I feel it was due to laziness. If you are not a lazy student and you put the time in, you can guarantee an A or a B. I had a 3 month old baby, a job, and took this class. I worked my butt off and made a B with a lot of help from Mr . Strong. He is an amazing teacher.;
Professor Cameron is a really enthusiastic guy, he is so well learned and his lectures are never boring. He really knows his stuff. He is a really tough grader though, I would get a B+ on his exam and he told me I did extremely well.I don\'t consider a B+ an extremely good grade, but he does. Focus on the topics he emphasized, they\'ll n on the exam;
3 Tests, no attendance. Very chill guy and you can tell he really knows what he is talking about. Lectures can be boring. Get the book and study his powerpoints and you can easily can a B or A. Best teacher if you have to take this class.;
Worst class I have ever taken. He is condescending and not easy to work with. In the online class, he calls out your discussion points in red that do not align with his philosophy and makes you feel like dirt when asking for help. I wonder if he even likes doing his job.- pompous and grumpy. Stay away from this class if you can!;
The professor is a nightmare. I understand that the professor is merely to show you a path, then you go upon a journey to learn. But when that professor only gives you a hammer and some nails and expects you to build the titanic, that\'s when I can\'t respect her. TLDR: She gives you basics, but doesn\'t help you with anything else. Suicide For Grade;
Dr. P is my favorite teacher at tech. took her for both virology and med & vet ent. Shes a great teacher and the classes arent too hard. take ok-ish notes and fill out the study guides she provides you for the exams and you\'ll easily get a B or A. another cool things is she never requires text books for any of her classes so shes a money saver;
horrible teacher!;
Great lectures, very friendly and ready to help. As said below if your study your homework and notes well then you\'ll do well on his tests. He gives out exercise worksheets to make sure you know the math parts of chem.;
I had absolutely no chemistry background but professor Tjandra gives really good examples so the material is understandable. There is a lot of work for this class but it\'s good practice for the test.;
He\'s honestly such a sweet guy and genuinely cares about his students, however his tests get more and more difficult as the semester goes on and he seems to be teaching less and less relevant material. Be prepared to do a lot of the learning on your own.;
Physics is a really hard course because of the department. I don\'t usually rate my professors, but even though this class was so hard for me, cuz I\'m no physics major, he really is one of the greatest professors. He cares about his students. He\'s brillant He\'s definitely worth taking the class from. He\'ll put in extra time outside of lecture!!;
Dr. Peters does a great job keeping his political affiliation out of his lectures. His class is not easy but he is a really nice guy and helps you succeed. All his exams are online (6 of them) and there is a cumulative in class final (based off previous exam Q\'s). The online exams are tough but it is not to tough to get B- or B. Tough to get an A.;
FYI Professor Scott Peters is listed on MyUniverse as Christopher S Peters. Dr. Peters has been an amazing professor for every class I have taken with him. He is so knowledgable on our county\'s courts system, and he is so good at teaching in a way that is understandable to those with no knowledge of law or politics. Highly recommend this professor!;
Great teacher! Everything he tests on is in his lectures that he has for you on his website. Extremely helpful and has the best interest in the students. If you make the effort he will go the extra mile for you! Some of the information is a bit dry but if you put in the time you will learn so much! Seriously awesome teacher. Tough class though :);
This class is really what you put into it. The Homework really helped if you at least try to do it before going to class. It was a usual Math class, she would solve math problems with everyone and she will answer any question we had. The class can be easy if you really do the homework.;
Due to illness/family issues I was only able to show up to class once a week (for our exams every Friday) and yet I managed to pass with a 80%. Class was not difficult, but it was a hassle to receive our grades and marks. And even now that the semester is over, I still do not have a final mark/grade.;
Tests are reasonably easy if you prepare, you are given test outlines! She is very helpful, gives opportunity for extra marks (bonus assignments) at the end of the semester. She is very well organized and to the point, one of my best professors.;
I found Dr. Zhang very helpful in such a tough class. He takes a lot of care in explaining proofs and making sure that the material is well understood. The class moves quickly, so make sure you do the homework to keep up. He\'s always willing to answer homework questions. Won\'t fail you unless you don\'t try at all.;
She uses real life situations to go along with lessons. There is homework every week, but like the rest of the class participation shows in your grade. Attendance is graded. Don\'t try to just write random stuff for homework or it will show in your test scores. I would recommend her. I will take her class every chance I get!;
Class seems overwhelming but it\'s not only 4 papers if you take it in her 6 week summer class. I got a B+ and did everything the night before. She is super nice and sweet just me it look like you care and you will do amazing just but little effort in.;
I really enjoyed her class! I undertood her teaching style, she was clear in her directoins and she helped me become a better writer overall. She does asign a lot of papers but she grades quite easy in my opinion. I would take her again.;
She\'s a very tough grader. She wants essays done very specifically to the style of her liking, and she\'s not very clear about exactly what she wants. She is somewhat helpful.;
Shes a very nice lady who likes to crack some semi-funny jokes. She is not a tough grader and is always willing to help, especially if you go to office hours. Class just consists of peer reviews which is fairly simple.;
Take advantage of the peer reviews. She helps comes up with ideas for the topics. Papers are only 3 pages long but they make you think.;
No Comments;
Just graduated from Oakland in May. Dr. Rorke is an amazing professor! He makes learning fun and inspires students. He is straight to the point and is serious about his students education. Enjoyed every class that I took that Dr Rorke taught.;
His lecture\'s aren\'t terrible so long as someone answers his open ended questions, he\'ll just stand there until someone does. He\'s helpful if you have questions but he\'s a bit odd. The grading isn\'t bad but the Journal Questions really add up so stay on top of the assignments.;
The lectures are pretty mediocre and there\'s a heavy workload for a 3 credit hour class. Your final grade is basically how much time you spent outside of class so it\'s 100% possible to get an A if you\'re willing to put in the time. If you\'re not a history buff and just looking to get a gen ed requirement I suggest you look elsewhere;
This is class is pretty easy but very boring. His class lectures are pointless and you don\'t need to take notes because they give you no information needed for exams,quizzes.He is a hard grader but i find it hard to believe anyone could fail this class.Everything is out of the books and he lets you do all your work at home prior to exams,quizzes.;
Steve is a very good teacher. I came to Canada from another country and English is not my first language. Steve really helped me to become a better communicator and I loved his classes.;
Although it was a super easy class, he made me hate the subject. He rambles on too much and his notes are all over the place. He does have a good heart and tries to get his students involved in learning, but he yells a bunch. Attendance isn\'t mandatory, but there is in class quizzes almost every class.;
"He does tell you what questions are exactly going to be on the exams, thats why I did well in his class. He\'s unclear in his teaching so I just memorize what he writes. I honestly haven\'t learned much from him. He says ""it\'s easy, a third grader can understand this."" He\'s been teaching this course for many years so of course it\'s easy to him.";
The content covered is very interesting, but the way that she tests you over it is not. Instead of testing over the themes of literature and the impact they had on history, you are expected to be able to identify direct quotes. There were only 4-5 grades for the whole semester and one of those was a group project.;
"Feedback was good, though I had to have ""tracking changes"" in Word explained to me. Pretty good for an online class. Lots of reading, but I expected that because of the subject. I always got a fast response to my questions.";
If everyone is quiet when she asks questions, there will be a surprise quiz. Read even if you don\'t understand because, if you ask questions, she will keep explaining in differnet ways until you get it. Do not skip the review day before a test. If you don\'t do well, go to office hours and ask questions. She\'s nice if she sees you trying.;
Her lectures are thorough but dry, and copious notes are required to retain the relatively unimportant details that seem to pop up on the midterm/final. Might be a better prof for a course that interests her more, but I wouldn\'t recommend taking Departmental 2 with her if it can be avoided.;
Worst professor I had at NYU by far. He\'s always confused in class. Papers are absolute nightmares. Based on his crazy model, they have no thesis and cause you to repeat yourself incessantly, and then come to no conclusion. His markings are very rude and his grading harsh. Impossible to meet with and gives 5 days to write 10 page papers. 100% awful;
I thoroughly enjoyed Dr. Evergates. While gentle of voice and speech, he packs a punch! Very entertaining, very informative. Loved the narrative style of his lecturing! Speaking as a non-traditional student, I think he is one of the most respectful and decent professors on campus.;
She is very passionate and involved with her subject - she will help direct you towards your own passion within the subject of Middle East Women\'s Studies.;
Doesn\'t really care about the course. Asks terrible questions on the tests that are completely ambiguous- asks T/F questions on opinionated topics. Says he\'ll curve final grades, but didn\'t for our class. Just a terrible course overall, don\'t take it if you don\'t have to.;
If you are bad at math just do not take his class at all. He is a nice guy, tries to be funny and joke around. But as a professor he is just horrible. he cannot speak English properly, he knows math, just cant explain it. He does not like confrontation either, if you talk to him about something he will take it personal and make your life hell.;
Pretty clear class. He wants what he wants, but gives you feedback on drafts in class and spends a lot of times making sure you understand stuff.;
Thom wants what he wants and is fair and resonable. he allows you to write on ANY topic, so some of the peer stuff is interesting, but it\'s cool to have that freedom. Good input!;
Dr. Gongaware was a very good professor. His tests are all online and only two one page papers. Lectures can get long and boring but some of the material is interesting. Just do the review guides and you\'ll be fine.;
What should have been an interesting an informative class was simply awful. We rarely discussed the required reading and the concepts we were supposed to be learning weren\'t brought up, let alone explained. I came away from this class hating theory with a passion.;
Absolutely wonderful teacher. Very knowledgable. 1test. 1little essay 1major essay. Very sweet Prof.;
He takes attendance at the beginning of each lecture. His lectures are not long and they are very clear. He posts them on his website so you don\'t have to go crazy jotting down everything. His exams come from the slides. Usually a few MC, Concepts and an Essay Q. He is a fair marker. There is also a 40% Essay. He is -also very understanding.;
Mr. B is very enthusiastic about speech, he loves what he does and it shows. Hes very easy to talk to, and will give you feedback on his thoughts of your speech. He creates a comfortable environment in his classroom so when you go up to speak it isnt scary. You must show up to his class or you wont pass, he keeps track of attendance.;
hes brilliant. he explains in detail. makes it look easy. its bviously chemistry no easy As.. u have to put in the work. but he makes it look easy. try not to skip class;
She is the worst as a professor! I got a B and that\'s for fail just 1 test cause I was late that day, I got A in all the other test.... She confused the students all the time, and never ask cause she laughs. Btw.. She always give study test that are exactly like the test, sometimes test were even easier. Honestly I pass this class cause my boyf.;
Excellent lecturer, gets you engaged and makes sure you leave class having learned something. Attendance is mandatory but you don\'t have to participate. Unfortunately, she has ridiculously difficult exams and a luck-based bonus system, which drags down your GPA. Other professors for the same course will have easier exams.;
I had Dr. McGill for Chemistry 141 and 142 and her courses this year were the pilot courses for the new Chemistry 150 and 2nd semester course. She did an amazing job of creating the new curriculum and taught it amazingly. She cares so much about her students and was so helpful during office hours. Take her if you want a good grade!;
She was an amazing professor who really took time to listen to her students. The class will require reading and includes a lot of organic chemistry as this semester she taught the pilot curriculum which is becoming the new Chemistry 150. It is a lot more focused on fewer topics and will help to prepare students for Organic Chemistry for sure!;
First off, Dr. Snider is hilarious! He adds humor to the chemistry which makes it a lot more bareable. The only complaint is that he grades formal labs extremely hard - it\'s almost impossible to get an A. Luckily, the other assignments will boost your grade and he was always willing to answer questions inside & outside of class.;
I loved having Val as a teacher!;
I\'ve had her for two psychology classes, PSYC1030 and PSYC2130. She is an amazing teacher and she knows what she\'s doing. She also does her best to help her students and goes over the lecture thoroughly. I recommend any of you to have her if you can. :);
If you need to take Patho then I highly recommend Professor Lombrana. I haven\'t taken a course in person in a long time and never cared for them, but Lombrana have a way of effectively teaching. He literally holds your hand and walk you through the material. He makes time to be there for you and genuinely cares that you pass and will help you;
Mrs. Lair is the best math teacher I have ever had. She is VERY organized with her lecture notes and explains things very clearly. She is willing to help whenever a student asks a question. However, you must be prepared for the class. If you don\'t know the prerequisite material for the course, you are in big trouble. Be responsible!;
Professor Praitis is helpful. BUT, she really takes off a lot of marks on attendance. She CURVES, not in a good way. If she wants only three A in class, she gives your final paper and poster Bs without telling you ANY REASON so that your overall grade can fall from A to A- or B+. On her class, BE CAREFUL on your every homework and quizzes.;
Don\'t do it, his tests are not checked, making some answers wrong that are right. He\'s hard to understand, thinks he is ALWAYS right. My last year in college and he\'s by far the worst professor I\'ve had as of yet.;
Hard to understand with his accent. Lectures were tough I passed with a B+ even with his review sheets. Really nice guy though! Just not recommended unless you know Math.;
Very sweet man! If you\'re the type of person who needs their prof to explain everything in depth(like me) he\'s your guy. Gives old tests to study for your exam, takes attendance and if you don\'t miss more than two days you can replace your lowest test score with your final. Accent is not bad, but you may want to sit close to him bc he speaks softly;
I recommend anyone who has to take stats should make sure they take with her. she explains everything so well and makes sure everyone understands the material. very upbeat and refreshing which helps for a stats class- especially at night!;
Oh my god this has probably been my worst experience ever as a student. She rambled on and on n on during lectures;
Professor Ho\'s lectures are convoluted and w/o structure. She gives nearly no opportunities for student involvement. That said, she is truly passionate about her work and her students and it shows in the lengthy and helpful feedback she gives on the four essays she assigns. The readings are amazing, it\'s just too bad we don\'t get to discuss them.;
His lectures will either bore you out of your mind or have you laughing every 5 minutes. He\'s quite entertaining and really funny during lectures, however very strict. He has a very strict policy about cell phones or any electronics for that matter, and I suggest not even thinking twice about using it during lectures.;
If you don\'t want to study and I mean really study for the tests do not take him, you will NOT pass. He\'s funny and makes lectures atleast interesting but he is very strict and class is mandatory. (you\'ll want to go anyways, not a class you learn on your own) You will need iclicker for random quizes, that you\'ll need to prestudy for. Solid choice.;
Professor Brooks is a character. I had him for both Bio-principals and Biodiversity. Attend every lecture, read the lecture notebook before class and you\'ll do fine. His exams aren\'t too difficult, and in my opinion were pretty direct. His lectures are enjoyable but beware he\'s very strict: no phones, no laptops, no technology whatsoever.;
He is awful. His instructions are confusing. He gives very long exam reviews and then not of it is on the actual exam. You get a minute to answer each question on Exams and they are the majority of your grade.;
Not a very good professor, but not the worst. Like going to Mcdonalds when you want Chick-Fila.;
I really like Finance and this class was a bit of a challenge. Gives hints on what\'s on the test and lectures are clear. I read the book for a better understanding. Goes through a lot of information during lecture, so make sure to go because powerpoints have many many blanks.;
Highly entertaining. Doesn\'t keep you longer than you need to be there. Simple assignments, though they do require work. Fun class.;
Lectures are essential to passing. She goes a bit fast but if you do the homework that she assigns (it\'s optional, but useful) then the tests will go smoothly. Always available to help during office hours. She gives extra credit by adding 10pts to 2 of the tests that the class as a whole did bad on. She doesn\'t do make ups so don\'t miss a test day!;
Tests are impossible. Help is scarce, homework has nothing to do with tests. The notes make no sense to reread. Gives extra test on finals week along with cumulative final.;
Sends the most hilarious emails, if you don\'t get his sarcasm you will hate him, accent is thick but still easy to understand. Attending the lectures is a must, content isn\'t posted online. Doing an assignment every week is annoying but easily brings up your grade. Midterms and exams were fair to what we saw in class, posts old tests and breakdown.;
He made me hate international politics. Should not be teaching lower level classes.;
She is clearly over her head and has no idea what she doing. She talks to hear herself be friendly, has no true industry in-site that does not come out of a book. She plays favorites, and is straight up two faced. Never take courses or the gaming degree from this school.;
Devote your life to her class, work hard, make many sacrifices and you will still not smell the paradise of an A. Only thing I liked about her class was before the research project.;
"Grades really hard. I do not recommend. Did not enjoy this class what so ever and felt really discouraged. On one of my descriptive essays we had to do for class, she wrote ""too much description"". I\'m sorry what?? Awful";
She was not there for the first two days of class and most of the majority of the semester. But she\'s very strict with absences for students which I think is stupid and makes her a hypocrite. She\'s very rude and egotistical. She\'s a grader nazi so don\'t expect to get an A. Overall, I recommend you don\'t take her and just leave her class now.;
"This is the worst teacher at hvcc. DO Not take her class. she is not a good teacher at all. she does not help. she does not give any good advise. drinks coffee and chocolate bars all class. grades really tough my friend told me to drop her before school started and i should have listened. absolute worst ""professor""out there.";
Having emails ignored wasn\'t all that great, especially when I was struggling in the class. For the most part, if you read the textbook and really study the material you can do good on the tests. You have to read two short books and do a group project, reflection, and quiz on them. The inquisitive assignments are impossible to fail.;
Homework due before every class, but it\'s only 3 questions. I would do the homework and not Chegg it because it\'ll help when you\'re preparing for the tests. Tests are similar to homework problems and the final was EXACTLY our homework problems.;
Awesome teacher I loved his class. I would love to take his class again.;
I\'ve always been bad at math and after failing college algebra the first time I never thought I\'d be able to pass this class. Bob Young cares about students and offers extra credit, amazing study tools online and in person, and other helpful tips throughout. Without his hilarious and effective teaching methods I wouldn\'t of passed this class.;
Really great teacher, who wants everyone to be on the same page and will go out of his way to make sure you know whats going on. Long lectures, and even longer tests, with some last minute marking. But overall a stellar time.;
Grades papers like you are a professional. All of my papers I never got better than a C grade on. He rambles on things that do not have anything to do with the work. I WOULD NOT TAKE HIM AGAIN.;
If I had known how difficult Potter was beforehand, I wouldn\'t have taken his class. He took forever to reply to emails, and when he did, he was rude and short with me. He took forever to grade papers, so you basically don\'t know where you stand in the class all semester. He graded very harshly on papers, and makes you feel stupid.;
Sorta Feel like his main goal is too make me fail, but he tricks you because he has a great personality but doesn\'t leave enough time to take notes.;
You absolutely have to read every night because she has pop quizzes so randomly. Sometimes once or twice a week and they are very technical questions that aren\'t multiple choice. and she doesn\'t drop it at the end when she drops your lowest quiz grade. We also has a paper that she changed to being worth 20 percent of our grade AFTER turning it in.;
great teacher, and very helpful always gives prompt email help, and the papers arent really that hard...;
I was really excited to take this class, but it really disappointed. The worst thing that happened this semester was the online book she made us buy, but then told us not to use it after test 2 and we didn\'t get a refund. This class isn\'t attendance based, but I would really suggest going because the tests are hard.;
Horrible teacher, expects students to understand everything he\'s saying;
If you haven\'t taken Spanish before, then prepare to be behind on day one. Senora Zahajko moves quickly and doesn\'t pause for more than a minute to help anybody out. Daily homework is heavy and she is unsympathetic if you miss an assignment. Very biased to her favorite students and will easily single you out if you fall behind.;
Definitely a very hard marker. If I had known what the class would be like I would have dropped in immediately. I think he would be better geared to graduate studies, as he clearly dislikes undergrads from his constant criticism of them. Wouldn\'t give out his email and office hours so after class help was impossible. Excessive amount of readings.;
Craig is amazing. At first you\'ll find him quirky and different but he grows on you. I made the mistake of missing lecture a lot and that really affected my grade because EACH lecture he grades and gives points for participation. He does offer A LOT of extra credit and his discussions are outdoor and super hands on. We did a lot, good experience;
I love Craig! His zoology class was really interesting and he\'s so adorable in a sweet nerdy way. Honestly he\'s my favorite teacher I\'ve ever had! I just love his personality, however, His class was extremely hard for me. I ended up getting a C and they was a miracle. The tests where you had to identify species by their scientific names were horrid;
Me Stettnar is a really good teacher. His lectures are very understanding.;
Cynthia is completely scatterbrained. She adds new assignments randomly and due dates change all the time, so you get confused by all of her confusion. Takes forever to grade. Exams hardly reflect lecture at all. Talks above what most people even know yet, like we are already microbiologists, when we\'re actually there to LEARN.... Horrible teacher.;
good man.;
Debra is a good teacher She is going to help you if you are putting efforts never miss her any class because she always teach something interesting and important;
I honestly think this class was pretty hard. Definitely go to all classes if you are not a history person even though attendance doesn\'t matter. Lectures are kind of all over the place and I felt like some of the info didnt flow well.;
Professor was awesome. I took the hybrid class (Lecture online, Monday lab only). The test can be difficult but if you do the homework and the study guides online, you will pass. Make sure to show up and do the extra credit. One of the best teachers I\'ve ever had and one of the easiest going and understanding professors I know. Thanks professor!;
She has her favorites in her class which I don\'t think is right. Some of her lectures make no sense, but she is a very nice lady.;
"Don\'t do it. Just don\'t... So much reading. She goes off topic. Not clear about anything. Doesn\'t remember due dates. The midterm and Final are essay exams. She\'s late to office hours. The subject is interesting but her class is ""No Bueno""";
I can\'t express how much I disliked her and this entire course. This course should have been driven through discussion and opions, but seems too only care about her opinions. She give too much work and grades way too harshly. If you miss one small thing on notes alone you will fail that assignment. Do yourself a favor and avoid her at all cost;
Her tests cover a lot of material, and she allows no additional resources. Those who have a good understanding of Algebra would probably do okay in this class, but If you struggled with Algebra at all in high school do not take her online. I have done fine in the other Math courses I have taken, but this class was too much ( I work full-time).;
"She is all over the place. Quizzes time you meet. She expects that you can write a PERFECT essay in 12 minutes (these are her quizzes). Tons of reading to do along with ""participation"" essays at the end of the class, which is timed & graded as well as the quizzes. She is extremely picky when she grades. You\'ll get a B- if you lucky.";
Elle Feth is awful. Her lectures are not only boring, but incredibly complicated and far too detailed. The tests and assignments are easy, but in the end, you\'ll end up regretting taking the course. The testa are straightforward, however, she uses confusing language and will not clarify. Do NOT take this course with her.;
The worst teacher I\'ve even took a class with in my enitre life.;
Just don\'t. Unless you\'re one of his favorites. It\'s like you think you understand the assignment - you could even meet with him about your ideas and he\'ll be supportive - and then you make a low grade because you apparently didn\'t give him what he wanted.;
Professor Malitsky is not a very effective teacher. There is no discussion section for this class and all her lectures are problems straight out of the book. She is also not friendly at all. All of the exams that go along with this class are a lot harder than any examples she does in lecture and are very hard to be well prepared for.;
To do well on exams you have to know the concepts well. She does a good job of explaining in lecture and provides good examples. She\'s a very straightforward professor and the exams are fair.;
While the content she lectures on is very interesting and done well. You will struggle to meet seemingly arbitrary expectations on the essay tests. Then as a added bonus, your class will receive a lecture in broken English on how bad your English skills are. The novelty of these occurrences fades quickly. I would not recommend this course.;
Terrible lecturer. Disorganized. The Physics department is terrible, and he is apart of this mess. You\'ll never know what you\'re doing, and their terrible explanations won\'t help at all. Good luck! Also, they have no official textbook so good luck finding what you need to know!;
I took this professor for both ENG 1301 and 1302 and I enjoyed the class. He made the early 7:00 class interesting because most like myself, were worked nights. I believe he is a hard talent to follow in his field. The professor is there to help you write scholarly papers. He\'s job is not to hold your hand through the process.;
Professor Ludwig gives extra credit so if you mess up on test the few extra points will help you and that was very much appreciated. He also responds to your emails in a timely fashion. I took course online and was a little confused but once I got the hang of it I was good. You can repeat assignments for better grade and that\'s just fantastic!;
Harihar Khanal is a nice guy and he knows math rather well. However, due to his accent it is hard to understand him very well and it is hard to learn from it. He does not respond to emails very quickly, and he loses some assignments if you turn them in outside of class. He tries to have a sense of humor but its more dad jokes really..;
I had this prof for both social theory classes and she is a great teacher. Has a very extensive grasp of theory, good relationship with students and very willing to help anyone who asks. She challenges enough to be considered tough, but not to the point where students are overwhelmed. A definite asset to the school and the department.;
He is a horrible teacher. Doesn\'t give good lectures. Rambles on and on. I would never have him as a professor again.;
Dr. Slusher wouldn\'t accept a hand written love letter from Channing Tatum if it wasn\'t APA format. She is crazy for the rules and reads the PowerPoint word by word everyday (good luck dealing with her voice). Tests are common sense, but difficult because there are 3 right answers but you need to pick the \'best\' one;
She\'s knows her stuff but I did not enjoy having her as my professor. She is rude. I could have made a better grade if I had known how to study. The questions in the back of the Fundamentals of Nursing book were helpful but you do best by studying the powerpoints. 1st test was mainly over the syllabus... Be sure to study.;
This was one of the most confusing classes. His handwriting is impossible to read and his lectures were all over the place. Basically memorize all the amino acid structures and know all of the pathways and cycles backward and forward.;
"Tompkins is a very good teacher who cares about you UNDERSTANDING not memorizing the material. His youtube videos are extremely helpful, but his tests and quizzes are extremely challenging and quite difficult. He does not care about your grade and makes it nearly impossible to get an ""A"" in his class. Too much information to learn for a 4 week clas";
Very hard class. Does not use textbook. Wants you to learn to derive formulas you will not ever use;
I would avoid this professor if possible....;
I took her for a fast-track class, it was worth it, but expect to put in work for your grade. She makes you do powerpoints at home and then the next day in class she re-lectures you on what you learned last night and its very boring. You need to show up to class because right after lectures you do a lab or learn an astronomical equation for tests.;
Interesting material but Beneski is really dry. He has a few good jokes, but the material is just so hard and it is hard to focus. Anatomy will take up your life so be prepared to study hard. It is doable.;
Tests are extremely difficult, definitely go to lecture and read the textbook;
Great professor and probably one of the most intellegent teachers I\'ve ever met. The test however are extreamly hard and you are expected to remember a lot to pass.;
DONT DO IT!!! I took this class online for a GE over the summer. HOUR LONG films from the SFSU library EVERY DAY! BORING! NO LECTURE! Every single one of her emails was condescending and rude. Did not do any teaching herself, she just piled on the work and sent rude emails about how students never put in work or effort. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!!!!!!!;
BAD professor. Killed my 4.0 GPA! Nice guy but does trick questions on exams. Avoid if you can;
Professor Caspi was super cool at first but then he did a complete 180. He\'s a tough grader and doesn\'t help when he\'ll is needed, does give good feedback, but he is no help. I learned nothing from the class. It was mainly theory and psychologist based which takes a lot to understand but he didn\'t care if you were confused. Avoid him if you can.;
If you will take his class it will be your nightmare semester. Course is very good to study but he studies like we have done Ph.D. and know all things. Lectures are sleepy. Homework is very tough as well exams. Don\'t take his class otherwise ready to ruin your semester and grades.;
Terrible she is not helpful when a student doesn\'t understand she is very harsh and makes them feel very stupid. Maybe she is better online but I had her for in person but in my opinion she was not a very good teacher. I can say I do not feel like I had a chance to connect with the material because it was not taught very well.;
Dr. McFadden is one of the high knowledge teachers I\'ve came across in my college career. She has a passion for teaching the students and genuinely wants you to learn and succeed. She enjoys the topic and you can tell it is her passion. Most of the real world experience she draws from is in healthcare and aviation. One of my favorite NIU professors;
Helped me grow as a student and was really one of the best teacher I\'ve came across at NIU.;
I will be honest, I am horrible at math. She teaches half lecture and the rest online. You must get them right or you won\'t receive credit. Have a question regarding the homework? She only has limited hours so expect to have a question or two only, because that\'s all you\'ll have time for. Get ready for a ton of homework. Tough.;
Moore is a pretty decent teacher, she helps and gives a lot of example during class if you\'re confused. Her test are a bit of a struggle and the homework and quizzes are all online. She does five of a ton of extra credit but make sure you don\'t wait till the last minute. All in all she wasn\'t too bad, I\'m horrible at math and she helped me pass.;
She is an incredibly smart person, but a terrible professor. I had her for an introductory class but she acted as if we were supposed to already know everything. She spent at least half the class rambling about nothing important and then wondered why nobody understood anything.;
As a person he\'s a lot of fun but pretty hard grader. Lectures are boring and not quite consistent, exams don\'t seem to be super difficult but even if you gave a correct answer to question, you still can get much less points than expected. Would not recommend THIS.;
Professor Griffin is not helpful at all. Her organization skills are very poor. We missed two weeks of class because of her personal issues, and we had no sub during that time. She does not explain anything right. Might come up with rude comments. Tries too hard to be funny. Very confusing. Tough grader. Don\'t recommend to take her classes.;
One word. DRY.;
awful. lowered by GPA so much. do not take.;
Unprofessional. Talks down to students. Not helpful. Rude. Lecture material is NOT a good reflection of what will be on the exams. Students and clinical patients complained about her attitude, demeanor, and overall lack of professionalism.;
Dr. Brown is great. She\'s extremely energetic, she can be hard to keep up with. But she really knows what she\'s doing. I would definitely recommend her. Anatomy is pretty horrible so having a good instructor makes a big difference.;
DO NOT TAKE!!!!!!!!!!;
To save yourself do not take this class. Max is like a robot and his lectures are boring. He gives pop quizzes, which stinks, and he only grades your grammar and punctuation. He also does not give good feedback, and is unorganized. If he mixes up your papers with another class you will get an F on that paper. For your own good, DO NOT TAKE HIM!!!!!;
As a person at MDC, he is the greatest. As a teacher, he is the toughest. He is very funny but his test are even funnier if you do not study. MUST put a lot of time into this class and attendance will cause you to fail if you are tardy or absent a lot. He will help you during office hours as well. Very lovable.;
DONT TAKE IT HIM\xe2\x80\xa6... FIU HAS A LOT PROFESSOR BETTER THAN HIM.I MOVED TO FIU AND I GOT A BIG A...;
he is such an awesome guy and really loves phil. Only hw is readings from the text and 3 tests (all essay style). Easy grader yet hard material. Def challenges your mind to a whole other level. Lectures are interesting so make sure you attend. Doesnt really have lecture notes so you must do the reading.;
I would never take a class with him again. He was a nice enough guy, and gave us many opportunities to get a good grade, however his exams/quizzes were very hard and very stressful. I felt as if going to class was pointless because the questions on quizzes/exams were nothing like what he talked about in class. Absolutely infuriating.;
I had her in 1996. She is a kind person who cares about her students. I learned a lot in her class. I didn\'t do all the work necessary and so received the grade I deserved.She was very fair and even gave me chances to make it up, but I was taking 5 classes and working full time so I didn\'t bother. She\'s a really good teacher, I liked her a lot!;
Mrs. Pruett is a great teacher but is extremely un forgiving when grading. If you make minor mistakes in grammar, or can\'t quite write a 1000 word structured essay in an hour in class without any preparation, or have not so good writing style, be prepared to struggle. She is really nice and helpful but her class is EXTREMELY difficult.;
If you have a lot of classes, and/or work, I do not recommend this class. She is a great teacher, opinionated but thoughtful. Papers due every two weeks, one semester paper, and participation in online threads mandatory (min of two posts, then at least two more as more people joined.) STUDY for the quizzes/tests.;
Because chem 12 is a lecture class, the prof can seem unhelpful, but Dr. Jurs is very helpful if you approach him.;
He is really awful professor, and he does not seem like helping student during office hours.;
I like him for the first few weeks Then, everything went downhill. He likes to digress a LOT. He NEVER gives hints about what are on the test, and he suggested to read up Carither slides EVEN though nothing similar on his TEST. If you want to understand and get good grade, AVOID HIM. HARRDDD GRADER ! ! !;
I had him for calc 1. I would definitely choose him as a prof. again. Homework isn\'t mandatory which means quizzes and exams are the only thing he grades. I didn\'t study as much as I should have and when final exams came, I struggled. He\'s easy to understand and helpful outside of class. If you show up to class, you shouldn\'t have any problems.;
No Comments;
Shes honestly the worst teacher Ive ever had. She grades poorly, shes rude, if you dont do something its basically the end of the world for her. Im currently in the class and shes nothing but rude and disrespectful to each student. Just sat outside the classroom with a few students and we all agreed shes the worst teacher here;
Not a great professor for so many reasons. He teaches pretty clearly and seems like a nice guy, until it comes to academics... His grading is tough, and almost no one feels prepared for his tests. Worst thing by far: he calculates your grade 3 different ways, and TAKES THE LOWEST. Why? Does he want people to fail?;
He is very knowledgeable and explains the material well, but his lecture can seem never-ending and his homework problems are a lot harder than the ones he goes over in class. They are also very long (some with 40 questions) but he gives you normally over a week to complete. I would suggest taking MWF to have shorter lectures or else you\'ll zone out;
Professor Yarmish is tough! She has a cold attitude and doesn\'t care about her students. She\'s very cut and dry and doesn\'t take any effort into consideration. Downgrades your grade for the smallest thing.;
She is a really nice person, but her lectures are hard to follow. She kinda is all over the place. She takes forever to answer emails and is hardly ever physically in her office. However she gives lots of partial credit on test which saved me. If you dont do the homework or study you wont pass.;
Useless professor actually liked marketing until this class. Try and avoid unless you like being bored to death.;
1 of the most frustrating experiences in my academic career.\r Lectures/study guides seem slight or opaque in regards to the assignments, which were disjointed in regards goals, if we were able to discern them.\r Feedback was critical w/o being constructive, & often irrelevant or inane.;
Dare-Halma for CS 180 is like shooting yourself in the foot if you A: Didn\'t take a CS class in highschool that went over basic things B: Can\'t make most of your time for the class. Her grading is very harsh, as your tests have a test review guide in which you MUST know EVERYTHING. If it correlates with anything, its on there. Bad For Beginners.;
It was VERY difficult to earn a good grade. She will write on the board notes that are verbatim to the book and won\'t explain it well at all (if she can, she sometimes refers to students for answers). The programs had me sitting in tutoring for hours on end. The review guides given are decent but very vague, overall avoid this prof if possible.;
Very ill prepared and scattered professor. Very often goes off on tangents that don\'t relate to the class. She does not explain even basic concepts in a way that everyone can understand, and instead writes definitions followed by a poor example. If you don\'t understand after that you\'re sol. First test had various students with grades below a 10%;
Mr Meany is mean. He is opinionated and quiet sarcastic. However, he knows his stuff. He can be a great teacher if you and him share the same ideas BUT if you don\'t then it\'s going to be a nightmare;
Only grades are papers and exams, he is a tough grader! You have an extra credit opportunity where you can type three papers, but you can only get a total of ONE combined. All tests are on quizlet but you only get 40 minutes for 40 questions. I thought the class was super boring. You have a total of 6 papers. Attendance is required.;
great teacher lots of help knows what she is talking about and doesnt stop till you do;
The professor is very knowledgeable. He is making a dry subject somewhat interesting.;
Doesn\'t like his teaching style. No power-point straight from the book. Not specific of what he wants in a paper. lectures are long and mundane. Makes you wanna go to sleep! Gets distracted easily.;
Mr. Hu is a very nice guy, but he\'s also one of the most difficult math professors I\'ve ever had. I struggled to earn a C, but Hu is very well organized and you can learn a lot from his lectures. Not recommended for the faint of heart but if you identify as a math geek and like a challenge then this is the guy for you.;
Tony is a competent professor. His lectures are understandable and he answers questions in a mostly clear manner. However, one thing that was annoying to me was how he bragged every other week about his amazing ratings on this website, and the awards he got from the school because of them. No offense, but he certainly does not live up to the hype.;
No Comments;
I can\'t say whether Prof Mitchell knows her stuff or not;
He\'s a wonderful, sweet man but he can be hard to understand at times. His test are hard because the proofs are VERY specific, but if you take detailed notes, complete the homework, and read the examples in the text book, it\'s manageable.;
Great lectures, fair.;
"This ""teacher"" will not inspire you to be a better programmer. He takes pride in deducting as many points as possible. Do you want to get 50% on an assignment because you forgot to comment the chapter/assignment number and didn\'t use 100% correct naming conventions even though your program runs flawlessly?Then this professor is for you.";
He\'s a nice guy and pretty good at lecturing. Tests are too hard for the material he presents. Visit him in the office, don\'t take his class.;
Homework is like 2+2 and the tests are like trying to put together a spaceship with a toothbrush and silly string. Good 1 on 1 but horrible in class lectures. Can\'t teach to save her life. She is helpful when you ask but you shouldn\'t have to ask 1000 questions.;
Tests are NOTHING like the practice problems. Homework does not correlate with tests in the slightest bit. Notes don\'t make sense. Labs she is helpful but that\'s it.;
He is a terrible professor, and his grading system make almost every students in his class to get F. You will never get 100 from his project, he will take off 33% of your grade by saying you do not meet Design requirement(which he make it on his own term). Crazy professor. STAY AWAY !;
There are only 4 projects, which you will get either get 100%, 66%, or 0%, and 3 tests that are almost impossible to pass. HORRIBLE PROFESSOR;
All he does is put up overheads and babble on for hours about things we don\'t know about, and not in a way for us to learn. Then there\'s the random stories he just goes off on.;
Dr. Roter goes through material so fast your hands will be on fire. Sometimes he doesn\'t go through the terms we need to know and expects us to know when the test comes up. His matching section in tests are vague so the only way is to take a guess. Unreasonable when the answer I gave was correct but wanted something else deduct it.;
Horrible! Avoid at all costs! Her tests are impossible and this class is very intense for a 100 level class;
Tests are almost impossible, her grading is extreme, and so hard to understand. Avoid at all costs!;
This class is not as easy as he comes across like it is. Study all material before test. Good guy though;
She\'s seems like a caring lady but her teaching methods are awful. She doesn\'t except late work, even with a doctor\'s note, does not reply to emails, and is difficult to speak to. I constantly felt like I was being judged by her when I participated in class, because she is very opinionated. I have all As except this class. STAY AWAY.;
The class was not useful at all. The most important thing is that this professor is fake and do not respect the students. Don\'t take her class.;
Dr. Spievak is a nice person, but as a professor I would never take a class with her again. Cognitive psych was a nightmare. She assigns long, dry readings for EVERY single class, and you may/may not have a quiz on every single reading or class period. No powerpoints, just speaks what you need to know. Very hard grader, never satisfied.;
Really good teacher, always tries her best to help and takes all her time to do so. Unlike several other teachers, she explains elaborately and her notes are so beneficial. Would take another class with her if I can. Thank you Ewa Duma!;
Worst class I have ever taken at UNC. This is a pre req for med schools and dental schools and most people in there are taking this class for that reason. This class is extremely tough and they do not try to help or explain things well at all. If you can take it somewhere else do it! I made the mistake of taking it here and now have to repeat it.;
Lectures were extremely unclear, the first midterm was a disaster. No one knew what he was asking. Tries to be helpful but makes students uncomfortable instead. He WILL interrupt you throughout your entire presentation, making it very difficult to keep things flowing. The content of the class is good but the instruction of it was very poor;
Tough grade. Do well on tests;
Unclear and seems to enjoy conflict.;
Hard grader, uninteresting lectures;
DONT TAKE HER. She is extremely unprofessional, talks about personal life in class A LOT yet still expects you to somehow learn materials and take tests on them. Basically a huge waste of time and money. Tests are confusing and unclear, will tell you you\'re wrong when you question her. Have to teach yourself basically.;
Dr. Perdue is the worst professor i have ever had. She does not teach well, at all. The only grades you get for the class are 4 exams (including the final) and the wording of the exams is difficult to understand. Very awkward teacher and she doesn\'t care about the students. SWITCH IF YOU CAN!!!!!;
I took this class in spring of 2007. This woman is highly intelligent, but if you aren\'t one of her favorites, then she will be rude to you. I just asked just 1 question in class during the 4 mos, she shut me up. I didn\'t learn anything from this class. I wasted my money on the text book.;
I\'m surprised to see that people had a positive experience with Dr. Fressola. She is disrespectful and condescending towards students. As someone whose original background is in teaching, her behavior is appalling. My dislike for her and her contempt for us did, however, motivate me to refuse to ever fail her exam. I passed out of spite :);
simply the worst professor I\'ve ever had, doesn\'t care for students, gives little to no sympathy what so ever, hard to talk to, and just not a nice guy. I recommend not taking this class, he is a tough grader, does meaningless quizzes;
Hardest undergrad class I\'ve had in my ec major. Exams are really hard. Would probably be easier if he gave you the tools you need. Your studying tools are 1 to 2 examples of the question which he will change drastically. You need to memorize the textbook, his slides, his lectures and google all the info he doesn\'t give you if you want an A. Avoid.;
He doesn\'t know how to teach, and on midterms, he asked questions that he did not cover/lecture. AWFUL professor;
Great teacher. you should probably learn the material before taking the course. Very hard even for someone who knows programming.;
Legend;
Spent hours studying. Not clear on homework assignments. Essays graded harshly. Should of dropped the class.;
Professor Abert was a good professor. He teaches a little fast in my opinion but he is very knowledgeable. He takes attendance but does not give any in class quizzes. 10% of your grade is online LONCAPA and this alone will teach you everything you need to pass the class. He does not give study guides for the tests but you can just review LONCAPA.;
"Other comments posted are bunk. Although he is conservative, he is very respectful of students who offer opposing views. Since con law is convoluted, inconsistent, and contradictory, Wilkins presents it as ""clearly"" it is.";
I felt so discouraged after this class!! I always thought when things are a myth there is no right or wrong answer, sorry but to him there is only his RIGHT!!;
Great Professor, Three tests, all Easy, one paper, real simple. always willing to help you out, Great in every aspect!!!;
the worst and least helpful math prof i have ever meet drop it now5408;
Dr. Davis is nice enough, but she is unbelievably hard. Was pretty interested in Political Science prior to taking her class, but now, will never take another one. Really tough papers with very vague prompts. Avoid her FYS 102 at all costs.;
No Comments;
I tried going to her office for help. She asked me questions, then I tried to answer them but got them wrong. She then said I needed to get help. Um, that\'s what I was there for. She has a difficult language barrier. No matter how much I did, I could not pass. Who grades homework anymore? That did nothing but have my grade go lower and lower.;
Val genuinely cares about her students. She can be intimidating with first impressions, but if you\'re struggling and go see her one-on-one she will work with you and help you understand the content. She is an amazing clinical preceptor who is very tough and makes you work hard, but is always on your side.;
He was a really sweet and nice guy. Homework is really tough.;
This class was really challenging for me. She is a good professor but moves really quickly so I recommend going to tutoring if you want to pass the class. Three quizzes, three tests and a cumulative final. Most people would get cs-fs on the exams. She curves the class at the end knowing that most people either drop or will fail.;
Amazing professor! She always had extra study sessions before exams and even before our final. The homework was pretty easy, all online and you could do it until you had 100% on it.;
She is really willing to work with anybody to get the grade that you want. She is the most understanding prof I have ever met. She will do anything you need to succeed in her class. Such a nice and kind human being.;
His exams are fair- half multiple choice and half long answer, and he gives partial credit even if you mess up. I didn\'t do a whole lot of work and I still almost got a B-, so try and it\'s an easy course.;
You essentially need to have your book, and constantly read it in order to understand what is going on. She doesn\'t lecture, but has you become the teacher in the course and teach everyone else. It\'s difficult to understand what is happening because she constantly switches between talking about the class and hypothetical scenarios without warning.;
AVOID HER!!!!!!!!! I couldn\'t stand her!!! She thinks she is funny but she isn\'t!!! I wish she is dead!!!!;
"I withdrew from her class. She is super tough and the class average can be between the C and D range at times. A lot of writing is expected in and out of class and is super strict about grammar and MLA format, one mistake and you are done. The class went down to about 8 students from being full when I withdrew. She ""tries"" to be funny.";
Professor Dearing\'s class is definitely not easy but she is without a doubt a great teacher. You really have to work for a good grade and attendance is mandatory to pass. Overall she was very helpful though, and wants success for her students. I would not recommend this class if you don\'t like reading. She also was very helpful with writing papers.;
The subject material and the professor\'s teaching style is boring but he does care about his students. There are only 5 homework assignments that add up to 30% of your grade. The rest is 1 midterm and 1 final. He curved both the midterm and final by 15% so many people were able to pass the class. You would have to try hard to fail his course.;
"Our nickname for B.R. was ""The Corpse"" because he was about 98% dead. I think if he smiled his face would crack. The tests were the most awful, obsurd things I\'ve ever laid eyes on. Oh, and I\'ll pay someone five bucks to ask him what B.R. stands for.";
Hardest teacher ever.;
If you have the option please stay away from her and any class she may teach. After one whole semester I did not learn one thing of value. She treats her class like it\'s going to be your major and runs it like a higher level course. Out of all my years in school Mrs. Zacate was hands down the worst teacher I\'ve ever had. Would never take again.;
I enjoyed his class and sense of humor. 5 total speeches, 4 indivual and 1 group. Mid term and final are tough.;
PAs are impossible unless you are a C wizard.;
challenging class excellent lectures;
Great class. Thought her book was great.;
The class is hard no matter where it is taken, and he does try to make it clear what random small things may be on the test which is helpful and he looks like santa so theres that.;
Awesome dude! I got a decent grade even though I skipped a bunch. Tough grader but hot accent. 8/10 would recommend! ;
He takes this class way to serious to the point where it\'s obnoxious. It shouldn\'t be that hard for a HIS116 class. Exams are all based on lectures, and he doesn\'t give any slides, notes are all vocal. Do not take if there\'s other possibilities.;
Dobson is a great professor. He is funny, engaging, and honestly teaches a lot to his students in the amount of time he has. That being said, he is incredibly difficult compared to the other professors that teach this class. If you are looking for a good professor who will teach you material, look no further. If you want an easy A, keep searching.;
One of the greatest professors I\'ve had the pleasure of getting to learn from. Very tough material but thats biology for yah, he did an incredible job at explaining methods.;
This teacher is great just a tough class;
This man is the most arrogant and self righteous person I have ever met. Told us on the first day of class that he doesn\'t assign A\'s, does not give his email to undergrads because we ask stupid questions, and overall makes you feel belittled. This man should not be teaching 100-level English.;
The instructor focused more on criticising students than helping them to learn and succeed. Thus, I was not at all satisfied with her approach to treating students, particularly those who did not speak English as their mother tongue;
Extremely interesting class. Explains things well. Tests arent easy but he cuts a lot of slack int he grading. Your grade is just your tests, so if you dont do well on one tests, you\'ll get a bad grade on the course.;
I regretted taken class with him. He is just horrible. It is very hard to apply what he taught in class on exams. He\'s not a fair grader. Coming to his class does not worth with bcos you can not apply what he teaches in class on exams and home work. I will never advise anyone to take his class. He will mess up your gpa. His labs grading are worst.;
Fantastic guy and great christian. the material that he teaches might not be the easiest but he will make sure you get through it if you try and show up to class.;
My worst grade for a course so far in university. I think it\'s the annoying overuse of textbook material that makes the class hard. It\'s very frustrating when all of your marks come from exams (based only on textbook material), and there are no assignments or lab work. His slideshow notes are terrible - they contain only words and no explanations.;
Everyone gets at least a B on group project. Sketchy grader on Essay Questions. Very nice though.;
online, met about 3 times throughout the semester! You must attend and be there the whole class time or she will mark you down. The book i highly used in the course, all your assignments are assigned from the book. Was not clear with instructions! groups were horrible, new groups each week;
She is a sweet lady, but the most boring professor ever. Good intentions, but I would avoid her class at all costs, I fell asleep every class. I have no idea what the class was even about honestly...wish I didn\'t take her. It\'s a shame because she\'s a nice person, but not a very good teacher.;
Very sweet lady. Her class is a little dry but it\'s the subjects you have to learn. Lots of group work/projects. No tests just a lot of papers/writing. She\'s very passionate about the material and that kind of gets in the way of her teaching, but she knows her stuff. Only 2 teachers for this subject and the other was much harder.;
Good as person but not as teacher. Very Very hard. If you are looking for an A, you will never get it in this class. Don\'t do it. In the essay i got 65 after that he gave us revision essay so i improved my essay as per his suggestions and he gave me 69, are you kidding me??? You have to be book author to receive an A in the essay. Hell NO;
It\'s very true. He\'s one of the best.;
make sure to do the story ideas. Do your beats as well. Buy the required book, most of the coursework is AP style. He cancels class to give students more time to work on the assignments.;
lectures the entire time. buy the textbook because you\'re going to have to make notes and teach yourself;
I really love this teachers enthusiasm, but the subject still bores me. Be ready for his long useless talking about nothing, but try to enjoy his sense of humor if you can. Study please, i wish i could fix my grade.;
Mann, is great! It\'s a hard class but I love it!;
"Would not recommend anyone to take his online course. According to Hassan, ""As far as I know, this course has never Audio or Vedio lectures because they are not developed by the departmentschool. So, we have to read the text book and then post any questions on any concept or methods here,and I will address it."" TA worked pretty hard.";
The lectures were so terribly boring. She was very unhelpful when I asked questions and seemed more bothered by my inquisition than anything else. Would not recommend.;
Absolutely ridiculous class. 100 pages of reading per week and the professor marks incredibly difficult. Hes a nice guy and you learn a lot but do not expect a 75+.;
Ridiculous amount of readings for a fourth year class. It seems like its a Masters class but isnt. I barely got a 68 because it was so damn difficult to keep up. Hes a really nice guy but marks really hard and expects too much.;
Ida seems like a great nurse don\'t get me wrong, however, her class sucks. Her tests are ridiculously hard and her lectures are extremely boring. She reads straight off the powerpoint so I could\'ve not even shown up for class but had to. The exams are all definitions of basically the same words. I hate that this class is a pre-nursing class.;
These pre-nursing classes were the reason I decided nursing was not for me. Your grade is dependent almost entirely on 2 exams and a final. The tests are ridiculous with definitions and random questions over APA format and god knows what. She walks around, and stands over you while you test. She is the only option, but I would not recommend.;
He can be every unclear. You wont get stuff back right away. If you need help DON\'T EMAIL HIM, speak to him after class. He says that attendance in mandatory but he sometimes forgets to even take it. He really didn\'t know our names even at the end.;
These is without a doubt one of the worst classes i have. he tells us to read the book for the quizzes then never puts that info on the quizzes. Grades projects and what not easily, but its hard to get good test and quiz grades...good luck with this guy;
Great guy, not so great lecturer.;
Great lecturer. Tough grader.;
Genuinely difficult professor to navigate, but that is mostly because he tries to make sure you understand the material, which his quizzes and exams directly reflect. Do not bother skipping class because he teaches directly from his powerpoints and will quiz you accordingly. Really tried and still made a 79.5. Yeah, and he doesn\'t round up either.;
Jay Ko told us one the first day of class, if you can\'t pass this class with me you shouldn\'t be taking it. He give you all quiz answers in the lecture and the test are comprised of the quizzes.;
LOTS OF PHYSICS INVOLVED!!! I\'m not a mathematical genius so this class and the test\'s were slightly confusing at times. Overall a good class though, I really received the help I needed when I needed it. I would recommend her .;
Beneski clearly knows his stuff but does not know how to teach it to others. Lectures are boring and monotone, making it very difficult to focus. Tests expect you to completely understand every aspect of the material as well as be able to apply it to situations. Recommend studying for tests weeks in advance, record the lectures and watch videos.;
Beneski is an intellegent man , he knows what he is talking about but is an awful professor. He has no idea on how to relay the message. Anatomy is a comprehensive class in which you have to take a 50 question test in 50 minutes, its absoutley obsurd. I got roofied one weekend and he wouldn\'t let me re-take a quiz, I had my hospital records also.;
His lectures are awful! He\'ll go on these long rants about random things, and half the time you won\'t know what he is even talking about. His tests are HEAVY on material, very tough to study for. The one thing I did like about the class is the analysis paper we wrote.;
He is very monotone and not very helpful. Only test grades and a lot of reading.;
Not a great speaker. We didn\'t use our class book at all. Required reading is a big part of this class. Lectures are long and boring. He seems awkward and says um 100 times per class. Take another professor.;
I wanted to take Foster but ended up taking Sierra. He is VERY rude. He talks SO fast during his lectures making it difficult to keep up & write down everything u need. He asks the stupidest smallest details about a movie or person on the test. He criticizes this generation so much & talks to u like ur an idiot. show up & don\'t dare use ur phone!;
This by far one of the most knowledgeable professors WMU has. Her class was tough and she makes you work for it but if you go to class and actually study the in class notes you wrote (that is exactly what is on the exam BTW), you will pass and more importantly LEARN. Probably wont get an A though. DO NO BUY THE BOOK DO NOT BUY THE BOOK!;
This teacher is very friendly, but the tests are extremely hard and she gives quizzes every single day in the last 10 minutes of class which I found very frustrating, especially at the end of the day after a 2 hour lecture.;
I loved Professor Sadkowski. He\'s a very funny guy with somewhat interesting lectures. You have to read a lot in his class or else you won\'t pass. His quizzes are based from his mini-books you have to read along with the class one. Read or else you won\'t pass. It\'s pretty hard to without them.;
Always read the pre-lab practice quiz questions.;
make 7 copies of the practice exam and continue doing it until your successful. make copies of the lessons and do along with her videos. in lab do all homework first then your quizzes. Your quizzes are what\'s on the test so practice the unit exam too.;
My favorite professor at Denison! There\'s no one better than Mark. That man knows what he\'s talking about...and as a young alum, he\'s got some crazy Denison stories!;
Too hard of a grader for a 101 class. GE grades, but follows Unno\'s guidelines and it\'s a bit ridiculous. I\'m no straight A student, but I do well on essays and I got a grade I wasn\'t expecting. My GE later said it\'s hard to receive an A on essays in this class. Essays are a good part of the class. First test also included Q\'s about grammar? Why?;
Assigns a ton of homework, said i\'d be able to do my work on my mac if i purchased Office365, which didnt come with 12 the required software for class. her lack of knowledge of current computer software and stubbornness caused me a lot of stress, i ended with a 79.1% getting a C, she did not round up even knowing the extra time i put into class;
My high school football coach could teach better than this man. Attendance is taken through clicker quizzes that have huge effect on grades. He is extremely rude 1 on 1 and belittles students. No formula sheet so good luck memorizing all the equations for the final. I guess studying 20 hrs for the final isn\'t good enough to pass. 50% averages rip:);
Dr. Brown is a great professor. She does tend to get off topic often but she\'s funny and cares a lot about her students passing! I can\'t wait to take another class with her.;
RUN FAR AWAY. I repeat do not take it. She was aware her entire class was full of nursing majors and were forced to take this class for our core classes and made sure she made it as difficult as possible. Her lectures are dragged on and she talks about the same topic for 45 minutes. Also, the power points do not help. They are literally 4 slides.;
Winn is clearly a professor who knows her material. Her course is not too hard, but not to easy. You definitely earn the grade given. She\'d very fair and very helpful. If you\'re lost with the material, she\'d help without hesitation.;
Literally the worst teacher I\'ve ever had! Do not take his class!!!! The average on every test was below a 65 percent. I studied everyday for at least 2 hours. The tests aren\'t relevant to anything you learn in class. He doesn\'t teach you anything. I ended up with a 79.82 percent in the class and he wouldn\'t round up to a B- for me.;

I\'m a junior and a I took him during my first semester at BC. His class is still the only class in my LIFE that I\'ve gotten a C in. His exams have nothing to do with the textbook, and his lectures are not coherent. I\'m writing this review because I want to make sure other students don\'t make the same mistake I did. DON\'T TAKE HIM!;
"I\'m torn about this professor. There was a distinct rudeness from him at times that was very degrading and stand-offish. I want to maybe believe he is too intelligent to communicate with people of regular emotion? At times he was understanding, other times I felt his subtext was saying ""You are an idiot and I am more intelligent than you.""";
It seems that when it comes to papers this professor doesn\'t care much about the writing. Instead he cares more on the punctuation. His quizzes are random and repeated. His lectures don\'t relate much to actually English.;
I have never met someone with so much knowledge in film production who isn\'t bull****ing me. A real cool guy.;
I cannot understand what he is saying. His notes are very messy and his handwriting is horrible. His tests are similar to the homework but he is not good at explaining anything. I had him for Fluids and Dynamics and both times were MISERABLE. Do NOT take him for anything!!!!!!!!!;
Dr. Nicoletto is a wonderful professor. However the exams and material can be very hard. Do not except the class to get handed to you. You need to at least study 5-6 hrs a day if not more. I recommend taking this class in the summer because the grades are better and the material is fresh on your mind.;
By far the worst teacher at UA. AVOID;
by far worst I\'ve ever had. UA should fire him today. I am a straight A student who got my first C because he was such a bad professor.;
Took it online over summer. That was the first mistake, unfortunately I had no other option. Took her 1-2 days to respond to my emails & even then, they were unhelpful. McGraw-Hill based course which sucks. Not enough time for the exams and will leave you rushing to guess. Unnecessary/tedious amounts of homework which take hours of your day. BEWARE;
One of the worst professors I\'ve ever had. She tells you to follow the directions carefully but the directions could not be more unclear. She initially introduced herself as the head of the computer and technology department at AACC, but there is absolutely no way that\'s true. If it is, shame on you AACC. She doesn\'t know ANYTHING about computers;
Took this professor\'s auditing class. This was the only class in the entire program I c received a grade below B- because he didn\'t teach anything and tested you on everything. I personally complained to the dean multiple times and was told he was tenured and nothing could be done to him. Waste of tuition! Seek another professor if you can.;
I\'ll never take her class never...!!!;
Mr. Abert was not my favorite professor. There were times that he would preform examples in lecture wrong, and he could not correct them. The lectures were unclear and hard to follow. Also, the tests were very hard compared to examples we had done in class and after talking to classmates, it was a communal feeling that we were not prepared for them;
"I said ""So Many Papers"" because the weekly ""blog posts"" have to be minimum 750 words. Given a chance to make them up. He uses an emoji grading system on the blog posts, so I constantly had to look at the syllabus to see whether I got a 3 or 3.5 or whatever. DO THE BLOG POSTS EVERY WEEK. They are a HUGE part of your final grade. Real make or break.";
Has a deep sense of the material, and the wonderful ability to explain through examples. Very helpful.;
He expects your to log in at different times to the discussion blog and reply to at least 3 peers with a minimum of 300 words. He doesn\'t even grade most of the things, he has his TA grade, Nancy. She is a freaking hard grader she does not cut any slack. Also, he assigns a homework assignment every week due on Tuesday at 10:50p.m. Don\'t get him!;
If you do the work, you\'ll get an A. Her class discussions were pretty depressing, and it was sometimes hard to know what she wanted in an assignment, but overall it was an enjoyable class.;
she taught me to be a worse writer. her comments were most unhelpful, and her attitude in the classroom is condescending and self-important. don\'t try to disagree with her;
By far the worst teacher I have ever had. He is probably one of the most brilliant at Wayne State, but does not know how to teach by any means. He spends whole entire classes doing proofs and does not even teach on what we actually need to know for his impossible tests. I will say he is helpful during his office hours. I recommend him to no one.;
Really tough class. Journal/review questions are lengthy and is more english oriented than history. Do homework everyday, get ahead quick.;
This dude moves super fast, has a thick accent, and has a grading scale which means its hard for you to improve your grade if you\'re not one of the smart people. Bad teacher, hard to understand. Lucky that I was decent enough at math to pass;
worst prof I\'ve ever had in 5 years at York! believe me, I studied.. I went to every class lecture.. I even went to the writing department for help and I still managed to get a C on my papers? he\'s very UNFAIR, everyone gets the same presentation mark.. stay far away if you want to pass! GREAT COURSE, he just taught NOTHING to do with the course;
Dr. McGill is very sweet and willing to help if needed. Her office hours are very helpful. The content is difficult but reading and chem mentors really helps. For fall 2017, McGill and Williams will be the only ones with experience teaching the new course, Chem 150, so take them!;
Exhibits a genuine love for Chemistry and cares so much for her students! And she\'s Canadian so you\'ll learn a lot about that if you take her class. It\'s a definite PLUS!;
Mcgill is going to be a hit or miss for all of her students. Her style was very much pose a question and watch students struggle even if they were going in the wrong direction before explaining the right answer. AKA very roundabout in her teaching. If you take her I highly recommend getting notes from students who have already taken the class;
This is my 2nd time in this class, and he explains things better than the other professor.;
her notes don\'t make sense while studying. calculations on test are immensely harder than what she teaches in class. has trouble explaining things. She\'s a kind woman who will try and help.;
Her tests are impossible. The class work and homework comes off as easy but the test are on a whole new level.;
Nice professor who helps when you ask. But shes confusing. notes don\'t correlate to the very tough exams. homework questions also don\'t correlate on exams. exams are tough. tough tough tough;
class is fun, we played games the whole time, super easy A, but when he talks he is so boring it\'s almost unbearable. I got an A but I don\'t feel like I learned anything. Nice old guy.;
Awful;
Memorization & regurgitation seem to be paramount. No powerpoints made available. Unrealistic in her expectations. Confusing lecturer.;
I have always been a good math student, so good it is my major. However, Conrad is a TERRIBLE teacher. He is hard to follow, and is corrected by his students AT LEAST once a day. Might as well take it online, because you will be teaching yourself. I will probably retake, because his 4 test are 90% of your grade and his grading makes no sense.;
Very helpful. Easily understood. Good grading scale;
Excellent, Innovative. Higher Ed\'s best;
As this professor was the only professor teaching the course, I had no option but to take her class. She seems to mean well and I\'m sure she is well respected in the Nursing world, but it was impossible to meet with her one on one and she failed to email me back a few times. Be prepared to study and pay attention in class or you will not pass.;
Dr. Slusher is one of the rudest professors I have ever had. She is the exact reason why I am changing my major this semester. She grades the semester paper extremely difficult. She treats her students like they do not matter. The exams are rough. She will tell you something will be on the exam, and it wont be.;
Professor Abramov, where do I even begin. His notes are confusing and his tests are extremely hard. He comes into class, talks for 75 minutes and then you leave and have to read the textbook front to back. The final was 15 chapters. He should retire, expect to self teach yourself everything. He is too difficult for an introduction course.;
Nice man, makes accommodations, tough marker;
She\'s a great teacher and knows her way around a piano. You will need to practice if you want a good grade.;
WORST PROFESSOR AT WCU! I have never had such a rude & uncaring professor. His lectures do little to prepare you for the exam and his power points are confusing and have slim to none useful info on them. I am pretty sure he is glad that his class is close to impossible. Not sure why he\'s a professor because it seems like he hates students & his job;
Avoid his class at any cost. He failed half of the class. Lectures are sleep provoking. Exams are tough. He doesn\'t care about his students. He assumes everybody has excellent knowledge in the subject. JUST DONT TAKE HIS CLASS.;
She doesnt really email you about anything, excpet to tell the entire class if your not doing your work then to drop. Her way of grading is really confusing and she is kind of rude.;
This professor does not care to help when you reach out to them for help. The tests are timed and are very difficult. I completed all my course work and I don\'t feel like I deserved a D. He is super tough grader when you need help or you have question about the assignment he does not answer in a good time frame. I still have not received a response;
Difficult an inaccessible teacher. He is one of the teachers that don\'t care about students. mean and inconsiderate. very boring lectures, stupid quizzes. Find another teacher if you can!;
Read your book and teach yourself. He\'s a great teacher and he explains the material clearly... after you\'ve already taken the test. The only test that actually reviews material you\'ve already covered in class is the final. by then it\'s too late. 8 people out of 30 stayed in his course til the end. I\'m sure i\'m not the only one who failed.;
Very rude. Is not empathetic at all, does she have human emotions? no one knows.;
I\'m amazed at the students who praise her, and can only conclude those were students she decided were good enough to favor, as she does this a lot. She covers way too much material at an insane pace. I type faster than average and could not keep up. You better be taking ONLY this course or have an amazing memory.;
Awful professor, his tests are RIDICULOUSLY difficult, and he doesn\'t give any hints about the exams. AVOID him ! or you will get D or F.;
If you have a dispute with your TA over a grade Madden will regrade it, and the grade he gives you is your permanent grade. According to his secretary, he grades harder than the TA\'s do. Therefore, he is not willing to consult you with such problems. The TA\'s this semester were terrible.;
mrs deguchi is a very tough tough teacher. you really have to work in her class to pass...but she is very willing to help out students which makes a her a pretty good teacher in my eyes.;
Horrible Instructor! Wish I had looked him up before taking his class. Change to another instructor immediately. Deducts points like it\'s going out of style. Fully functioning solutions with documentation deducted points for unclear technicalities.;
WORST PROFESSOR EVER! I have never had anything below an A in English and I have a D. I have never been so dissappointed in a professor in my life. She is terrible and she is very mean and often comes off as rude. She calls people out and she tears them apart. shes like a vicious DRAGON. she skipped class more than I did and were way behind.;
Pharmacy Majors !Wrong Guy! Take somebody else, especialy if you have to take organic chemistry with this class.;
This was by far the worst class of ALL my classes offered at KVCC. This Instructor talks way above your head. Doesn\'t offer any extra credit to help you out and if you let her know you are struggling she will tell you straight to your face that you should reconsider your goals for the future!!! Horrible;
he makes bio so hard to understand. Very smart but doesn\'t know how to make the material easy to understand at all. I studied incredibly hard for his exams, worked with friends, etc. and failed all exams. There are 4 exams all worth 100 points. He crams 5/6 weeks work of material into one Exam. you will be lost with him as your teacher.;
Professor griffin is very rude . She missed class at least three times for personal reasons, which is fine , life happens !!! But lets hope it doesnt happen to you because she will give you an F for missed assignments ! No late turn ins. She is unreasonable . Rude. And unhappy . I worked extremely hard and still for a D . Her grading is bias.;
Excellent professor. Tells u exactly what will come up on the mid-term and final. Assignments are straight forward. The course is not that hard and he makes it even easier. Getting an A is not so hard provided you do weekly practice of the questions. Good luck;
Paul was a nice guy, but he was a ridiculously hard grader. He had no grace with any grades. Over the top and should not be teaching. He is too smart to be teaching college kids. If you dont talk in class you dont get any participation points. I would NEVER take him again. Im telling you, SAVE YOUR SELF!!;
This was the worst. Her programs are long and the homework had no clarity at all from the textbook and her graders had to grade them without the answer key and grade a week after they are turned in along with getting the answer key. Her tests were long (coding part). She expects you to read alot from the book, but goes out of order.;
Very difficult to understand notes. Concepts are not explained in simple terms. Seems like she thinks we are already supposed to be chemists or something.;
"I still don\'t understand why I had to take her class.. but don\'t. She does not explain anything, you\'re basically on your own, she gets mad or aggravated if you ask a question that does not go with what she\'s teaching that day. If you have a question she will make you wait until class ends or she simply says ""you should have asked me before class""";
I\'ve spoken with a few other students and we have all had similar problems this past quarter. The practices for exams are nothing like the actual exams, and the questions on homework can be extremely confusing. Doesn\'t really post much in the class or answer messages in a timely manner. No notes allowed, even though you must memorize a lot.;
Why were most of the recent bad reviews deleted? Bruce is probs reporting all these lol;
Well organized. Knows his stuff. Show up for call on time and hand in homework when it is due. Don\'t let his classroom personna fool you, he really a nice guy who cares a lot for hthe student.;
Don\'t take her unless you can teach yourself outside of class. she\'s a terrible teacer plus her monotone in 8am.. sigh.. not the best teacher.;
"Does not speak comprehensible English, you will not understand him he calls ""n"" yen and ""s"" yes and says yes after every word so when you need ""s"" he says yes yes making it impossible to understand. There are many other butcheries of the English language. He thinks himself hilarious and will laugh at his own jokes and no one understands what said.";
worst class. The lecture is word for word from the book, with unclear explanations and no way to answer questions. This class was not supposed to be hard, but it was and more difficult with this instructor. She spent more time talking about investing in stocks and how she started a business when she was 12 years old than she did teaching !;
She will unleash the beast if she catches you with ANY technology in your hand. Most difficult class I have ever experienced. Professor seems as though she hates her life and likes to take it out on innocent students. Lecture slides are irrelevant and she talks too quick to catch anything. DROP THIS CLASS ASAP.;
Dr Hardy is extremely rude. He will laugh in your face about questions you ask. At one point he told me he wasnt talking to me anymore. Also he is not willing to work with you when you have a issue. Our online system calculates grades wrong I received a D but if you calculate it it adds up to a B he still wouldn\'t fix it. Saying it wasn\'t his issue;
She made it difficult to ask questions. She made me feel like I was an idiot by not understanding. She seems veryyyyyy intimidating.;
Dr. McGill is very nice but her class can be very challenging. She offers extra credit for groups if the group average is above an 80. The class consists mostly of group work on worksheets rather than actual lecture. It was sometimes unclear what chapters we should be reading. Generally we ran out of time before we could go over worksheets.;
Gives you a zero on your project if you are missing a newline or have entered an extra newline, even if the project is 99% functional. Is unwilling to help you, even if you meet him in person. I met him in person and asked what I could do differently, so he asked me what I could do differently. Wtf.;
I had an A at midterm and then she lost my papers after taking a leave of absence for over a week (right before finals.) I can only imagine her TA\'s do all of her grading and getting your grade changed is a hassle as she never replies to calls OR emails. Being a professor is clearly not her #1 job, so beware.;
This guy doesn\'t give any feedback related to the writing process. Although I had my paper proofread by writing labs, he nailed me because he didn\'t like my MLA format and what I had to say. The MLA was checked by professionals and my views are simply that, my views. Gives incompletes if you don\'t label exactly how he said regardless writing;
Litterly studied so hard, and the final didn\'t make any logical sense. Most of the questions were concepts that have never even been relayed in lectures or the textbook. it was almost as if I wrote a completely different course exam that I KNEW nothing about. guessed every question. cried during it;
Dr. Boucher seems to be a nice person that wants his students to do well, however, he expects a great load of work and participation in class. As an incoming freshman I managed to do pretty well in all of my other classes except this one. It felt like more of a philosophy class that was set up for failure rather than a normal history class.;
Simple. Do not take her. She never replies to emails, she\'s very snappy in group chat if you ask a question. She also gives low grades on assignments and it is a requirement to watch movies in the library (even though it\'s an online class). She grades work late and gives a ton of work and it\'s only a 100 class. Everyone in my class failed.;
I was expecting this class to be easy, it is not. This is a lecture class, you can expect to have a reading assigned every singe class period and half the time he unclear about what needs to be read. I had multiple quizzes, where the questions were irrelevant to the story that was read. I have to take this class again with a different prof. now;
I took this class online in the fall. It is basically self-teaching, and I fell behind. Everything is on a e-book, homework, quizzes, ect. He doesn\'t teach anything, you teach yourself. LOTTS of hw, you\'ll find yourself behind. I failed the class;
I\'ve previously taken the online course to avoid the in class nonsense. Didn\'t make a difference with her grading and lack of communication (emails). Never the less, Jenni expects the most out of her students. No excuses are tolerated. You\'ll read 4 books in 1 semester . If you don\'t complete the book reviews you will fail. Honesty doesn\'t matter;
Great guy but doesnt teach you how to do the homework at all and is a very strict grader. stay away!;
RUN AWAY!!! Even though I was warned about her horrid teaching skills I still took the class thinking I could pass by learning independently or with a tutor... I was sooo wrong! Don\'t take stats with Judy! Her philosophy on teaching is students read the text book three times and don\'t ask questions. Worst teacher I have ever had! EVER!;
His exams are way harder than his quizzes and the homework he assigns. I got A\'s and B\'s on all his quizzes. I went to tutoring 3x a week and to peer study sessions once a week. I went to him for help and was told that he doesn\'t expect much from his students and he doesn\'t understand why I\'m struggling. I attended every lecture.;
Horrible teacher. He was confusing and boring. He graded weird. Really was not considerate if you did not understand. DONT TAKE HIM!!!;
"The worst class I have ever taken. Attend tutoring twice a week in addition to seeking outside help. Very condescending. After asking to go over a homework question during the allotted time he responded by saying ""I can\'t believe you asked to go over that"". Overall rude and not helpful at all.";
This was the hardest most stressful class I have ever had.;
he\'s a really nice guy, but the class is often unclear of his expectations and requirements...If you love suspense and want to be left guessing the whole semester, he is your guy;
Terrible grading system. Believe us on the posts here to take a different teacher if you can. I thought it would not be as bad, I was wrong. TAKE ANOTHER TEACHER IF YOU CAN.;
Stokesbury knows his****. I learned more in this class than any other I\'ve taken at GSU. But his testing methods are pretty archaic. He\'s from the old school of-chew-you-up-spit-you-out-and-see-if- you-can-dance kind of teaching. And he\'s a dick.;
very unclear does not know what she actually wants your papers to be about. You get to choose your topics but she is very particular. Grades harshly!;
Avoid at all costs because she does NOT use Canvas and will never tell you what your grade is because she also teaches high school and uses that as an excuse.;
One word. NIGHTMARE;
She\'s the worst professor I\'ve ever had at PCC. She basically copies the textbook to the board and she calls that a lecture. She wasn\'t even able to answer any questions. It really made me wonder why I was in that class. I DO NOT recommend you to take her even if you are good at math. Her class will bore you to death.;
Worst Spanish teacher ever. I\'m a fluent Spanish speaker and I failed her class. She does not know how to teach Spanish in a way beginners would understand. I bought the textbook and never used it. I had to correct her multiple times during class to. DONT TAKE HER CLASS;
He is a VERY tough grader. He docks points for almost anything. All his tests are completely fill in and are very confusing. He is biased towards his book, being that he is the co-author & doesn\'t try to explain concepts in a different way even when students don\'t understand. He does not show interest or concern about his students. DO NOT TAKE HIM;
Best class I\'ve ever failed;
He is a great teacher do not get me wrong, but he is teaching format is for students who clearly grasp the concept of math! i am terrible at math and i did terrible in this class! DO ALL HOMEWORKS! ATTEND ALL CLASSES! If you are good at math i advise you take this class because it may be easier for you.;
really challenged me to reflect on what it means to hate people...;
He Has Us To A Lot Of Speeches & Quizzes. Bought 2 Books But Only Used One. Is An Okay Grader. Would Choose Someone Else...;
Professor Green is one of the worst mathematics professors I have ever had. She is almost always tardy to her own class but will reprimand those students who come in after her, even when she is 15 minutes late. Ask her for help or clarification and she will laugh at you. Claims exams come from the department so you can\'t blame her for failing. BAD!;
I would not recommend Park for people who struggle with math. She speeds through problems assuming everyone is following along. Tests are whatever.. Still failed the class because your grade is solely based on 3quizes 3exams and final. This prof Is great 4 people who are good at math or have taken stats before.;
Prof. goes though lectures extremely quick and easily left behind if. Test were extremely hard, and hard to understand.;
